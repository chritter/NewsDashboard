22-11-2005,1,"Absa reports solid growth with Barclays in control Absa , the South African banking group , said its integration with new majority-owner Barclays was proceeding well as it announced a jump in its interim profit . The country 's biggest retail bank saw pre-tax profit for the six months ending September 30 rise from R3.33bn to R4.12bn ( Pounds 360m ) . Absa yesterday reported good growth across its business units , including retail , commercial , and wholesale and international banking . Steve Booysen , chief executive , said he expected the growth momentum to continue for the rest of the year . Barclays paid nearly R28bn ( Pounds 2.44bn ) for a controlling stake of Absa in July . The UK bank , which has committed to cap its stake at 60 per cent , owned 56.4 per cent of the bank at the end of September , Absa said . The strong performance allowed Absa to lift its interim dividend by 68.4 per cent to 160 cents a share . Net interest income was up 21.1 per cent at R6.25bn. Absa said an implementation programme promising to produce R1.4bn in annual synergy benefits was progressing well . The banks are in the process of cutting costs and boosting revenues by using Barclays ' global purchasing power , information technology and risk capability . The banks have estimated the implementation costs for the merger at R1.8bn. The merger will see Absa extend its reach into sub-Saharan Africa by acquiring nine of Barclays ' operations on the continent outside South Africa . Mr Booysen told the FT that he was "" very bullish "" about South Africa 's chances of meeting the government 's target of sustained gross domestic product growth of 6 per cent . Sound economic policies and planned infrastructure spending , coupled with the growth of the black middle class , made the target achievable , he said . With 6 per cent growth , "" you can grow on the economy , not at the expense of competitors , "" he said . Absa is South Africa 's second-biggest bank by assets , which totalled R381bn at the end of September , up from R311.5bn a year previously . It has the most customers of any South African bank - 7.5m , up from 7m six months earlier . Mr Booysen said he expected two interest-rate rises of 50 basis points each next year . Economists have warned that a rate rise could damp South Africa 's consumption boom , from which banks have profited . Absa lifted its interim dividend by 68.4 per cent to 160 cents a share . Shares in Absa fell 50 cents to R88.80.",absa reports solid growth with barclays in control
2-10-2013,3,"Aggreko falls to two-year low following Unilever warning Just two paragraphs long , Unilever ' s overnight profit warning may have been brief but its effects were wide , writes Bryce Elder . Aggreko dropped to a two-year low in reaction to Unilever 's warning that currency devaluations had held back emerging markets growth . Shares in the temporary power specialist dropped 3.9 per cent to pound(s)15.41. Short sellers have been targeting Aggreko on the argument that , since the company bills its emerging markets customers in dollars , local currency weakness was likely to be stalling investment decisions . About 10 per cent of Aggreko 's free float is loaned to short sellers in advance of a trading update from the group due at the end of the month . Unilever itself dropped 3.4 per cent pound(s)23.58. Analysts were worried by the breadth of its problems as imported cost inflation squeezed disposable incomes , with Brazil , Colombia , Mexico , India , Thailand , Bangladesh , South Africa and Russia all said to have deteriorated sharply in recent months . "" Although most staples companies have acknowledged some signs of organic slowdown in the third quarter , at this stage only Unilever has talked so broadly about the size and geographic spread of weakening demand , "" said Barclays . Barclays saw SABMiller and Coca-Cola HBC among the most vulnerable , seeing 2014 earnings downgrades of up to 10 per cent and potential downside for the stocks of around 25 per cent and 45 per cent , respectively . SAB , which takes more than a quarter of group sales from South Africa and Colombia , fell 2.8 per cent to pound(s)30.55. Coca-Cola HBC was off 1.4 per cent at pound(s)18.25. Bullion miners held back the wider market after gold fell below $1,300 an ounce .

William Hill climbed 3.1 per cent to 415.5p as the clearing of a stock overhang inflated volume to about three times the daily average . Separately , William Hill management was said to have met investors overnight , which helped bolster confidence that the adverse sporting results reported by peers were no more than a blip that had already been priced into the market . EasyJet was up 3.1 per cent to pound(s)13.18. helped by Redburn "" buy "" advice , while IAG was up 1.7 per cent to 344p . The airlines , which have both gained 123 per cent over the past year , will provide monthly traffic data tomorrow . In a buoyant insurance sector , Aviva was up 2.8 per cent to 408.1p after Merrill Lynch repeated a "" buy "" recommendation . Chief executive Mark Wilson gave a confident speech to a Merrill conference last month on improving cash generation and restoring its dividend , the broker told clients , adding : "" We think that can happen faster than consensus expects . It is highly likely , in our view , that further costs savings above the planned pound(s)400m will be delivered . "" Merrill was also keen on Rolls-Royce , up 2 per cent to pound(s)11.34 , which it said had been oversold . Credit Suisse advised taking profits in African Minerals , down 6.1 per cent to 211.3p. While last week 's investment deal with Chinese metals trader Tewoo had the potential to lift African north of 300p , the Sierra Leone miner remained vulnerable to falling iron ore prices , Credit Suisse said .

27-06-2007,7,"Ailing group 's plea on Barclays debt deal Biofuels Corporation , operator of the UK 's largest biodiesel plant , yesterday warned insolvency was unavoidable unless shareholders agree a Pounds 40m debt-for-equity restructuring under which Barclays , its banker , will take over the business . Facing debt of Pounds 100m and market conditions that have made its production of biodiesel unprofitable at current price levels , Biofuels has only been able to continue trading as a result of Barclays ' support . The group , which raised Pounds 44m in two placings to help fund its creation of one of Europe 's biggest biodiesel plants at Seal Sands , Teesside , now proposes to cancel its Aim listing . "" If the restructuring does not proceed , an insolvency process will be unavoidable , "" it said yesterday . "" In such circumstances , given the level of existing debt , shareholders will receive no value . "" The deal requires backing from 75 per cent of Biofuels ' shareholders at an extraordinary meeting to be held on July 23 . Biofuels shares , which floated at 75p in June 2004 and had peaked at 311p in March 2005 , yesterday fell 4 3/4p to 7p . Sean Sutcliffe , Biofuels ' chief executive , who owns 58,000 shares , described the company 's troubles as "" disappointing "" but added : "" This reflects reality today in terms of the market and the balance sheet . "" He said investors should not be scared off the renewables sector , but "" the market support mechanisms need to be very clear and long term to encourage investment . We are asking people to make risk investments , so we need long-term structures in place "" . Under the proposal , ownership of 94 per cent of the equity in Biofuels Corporation Trading will transfer to Barclays in exchange for Pounds 40m of the existing debt . Barclays will release the group from its obligations to repay all outstanding debt and provide funds to pay all outstanding creditors . The plan means Biofuels , to be renamed Earls Nook , will have a 6 per cent minority shareholding in Biofuels Trading as its only significant asset . Biofuels ' executive directors - Mr Sutcliffe , finance director Andy Leeser and commercial and operations director Richard Nickels - will become directors of Newco , set up by Barclays to control its 94 per cent stake . Newco 's chairman , appoin-ted by Barclays Ventures , will be chemical engineer Stephen Boyd , chairman of Pittards . Clare Spottiswoode , also deputy chairman of British Energy , is to quit as a Biofuels non-executive . High vegetable oil prices and low biodiesel prices have exacerbated Biofuels ' difficulties , which originated in decisions by previous management . These included a hedging deal that cost it Pounds 50m when prices moved against it and technical problems . It is pursuing a potential claim against plant providers Energea . Biofuels ' results for the year to March 31 , published yesterday , showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 32m ( Pounds 74.4m ) . This included interest charges of Pounds 10m ( Pounds 11.7m ) and exceptional items of Pounds 12m , including a Pounds 6.8m asset impairment change .",ailing group's plea on barclays debt deal

24-08-2006,17,"Annual profits up 63 % at BHP *Mining giant predicts the bull run will continue *Investors unimpressed by Dollars 3bn share buy-back BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining group , yesterday forecast an extended commodities bull run on the back of supply shortages and strong growth in demand , as it reported record earnings and announced a Dollars 3bn ( Pounds 1.6bn ) share buy-back . Charles "" Chip "" Goodyear , chief executive , said he expected to see further increases in demand from China , the world 's fastest growing economy , as well as a pick-up in Europe and Japan , offsetting any slowdown in the US . Metals prices would also be supported by supply constraints and disruption . "" A supply side that struggles to cope with demand will be characteristic of our industry in the short and medium term , "" he added . Mr Goodyear said during a conference call yesterday : "" Over the next year , we do n't see anything that gives us great concerns but the supply side does take time to respond , both in terms of new projects and disruptions . "" He said the disruption from the 16-day strike at Escondida , the world 's biggest copper mine in Chile , was manageable , adding that it was important for the group to stick to a wage structure that was suitable for the economic cycle . Workers at the mine , which is controlled by BHP , emphatically rejected the company 's latest pay offer this week . BHP said that annual net profits rose by 63 per cent to Dollars 10.45bn after a 77 per cent rise in second-half earnings . Mr Goodyear said there had been some moderation in costs in the second half because about 60 per cent of the cost increases in the past financial year were incurred in the first half . He said about 70 per cent of the rises were cyclical , so they would come down if the commodities market started to reverse . The share buy-back will focus on BHP 's London-listed equity , which has been trading at a discount of about 5 per cent to the shares in Australia . "" You want to buy in the cheapest place and that 's certainly what we intend to do , "" he said . However , the share price fell yesterday , closing down by 1.3 per cent at ADollars 28.39 in Australia . Analysts said investors had been expecting BHP to return more money or offer a special dividend . Oil was one of the few underperforming sectors for BHP because production was flat . But the company said it was optimistic that new projects would soon change things - notably Atlantis in the Gulf of Mexico , which has seen big cost overruns but should eventually produce 26m barrels of oil a year . The oil division represented about 19.4 per cent of earnings before tax in the past year . Mr Goodyear said there was "" plenty of opportunity to spend money "" in the cash-rich mining sector but indicated that BHP would probably monitor takeover activity from the sidelines . "" There 's not a whole lot that we are not in . If there 's something that makes sense , yes , but we do n't see a lot of holes in the portfolio .

25-09-2008,19,"B&B strikes Barclays support deal BANKS ; Move follows credit rating downgrades ; Higher-rated third party needed Bradford & Bingley , the embattled mortgage lender that has been downgraded to one notch above junk status by Moody 's , yesterday struck a deal with Barclays to act as a counterparty for its covered bond programme . B&B was forced to look for a new interest swap provider to stand behind its covered bond programme following an earlier ratings downgrade in July . Moody 's downgrade meant B&B was forced to find a third party with a higher credit rating to fulfil the role . Covered bonds are usually backed by mortgages and are normally seen as ultra-safe because they are also guaranteed by the issuing bank . B&B has been under mounting pressure in recent days because of the difficult wholesale markets after it was downgraded by Moody 's , Fitch and Standard & Poor 's amid fears about its rising arrears . B&B 's credit default swap spreads - a guide to the risks for debt market investors - yesterday rose to 812 basis points , double that of a month ago . Because B&B is only 43 per cent funded through retail deposits , a downgrade to junk status would make it tougher to access wholesale funding and could lead to equity investors abandoning the stock . Possible triggers for a downgrade could include a profit warning if arrears were to deteriorate further . S&P said that its downgrade reflected the view that "" constraints on B&B have increased materially in recent weeks , although liquidity is currently strong "" . It believes that concerns over asset quality in B&B 's loan book - which is 85 per cent made up of self-certified and buy-to-let loans - "" mean that wholesale unsecured lending markets are effectively closed to B&B and as a result this source of funding has substantially declined "" . However , B&B shares rose 1/4 p yesterday to 25p after it struck a deal to avoid taking an additional pound(s)1bn in mortgages on to its balance sheet and renegotiated its agreement with GMAC-RFC , the UK arm of the US financial group . Under the original deal with GMAC , B&B was committed to absorbing mortgages worth a further pound(s)1.75bn by the end of 2009 . Instead , B&B will now take mortgages worth pound(s)500m by the end of the year and a further pound(s)225m-pound(s)250m in the first quarter of 2009 . Arrears on the GMAC mortgages have turned out to be significantly higher than on B&B 's own book , adding to concerns about the bank 's capital position .

Trevor Bish-Jones , chief executive , warned that profits next year would be Pounds 10m down as a result of Tesco changing the terms of a contract with Woolworth 's Entertainment UK venture , which supplies the UK 's largest supermarket group with music and films . In addition , he said it was unlikely that the contract , which accounts for 40 to 45 per cent of the unit 's sales , would be renewed . It has one more year to run . While Woolworths hoped to replace most of the lost business with other clients , Mr Bish-Jones said if not the freed working capital would find a good home . "" I am fairly confident that we will find better investments for it . "" Woolworths ' chief executive highlighted the development of its online business and ruled out a return of cash to shareholders , as demanded by Woolworths ' investor Elliott Associates last year after an aborted bid by Permira . For the six weeks to January 14 gross margin at Woolworths rose 0.4 percentage points . Strong performances in toys , stationery and computer games kept the underlying sales fall to 0.8 per cent . This was considerably better than many analysts had expected , with Tony Shiret at Credit Suisse forecasting a fall of up to 3 per cent . For the year to date , total sales are down 4.1 per cent and for the year to January 29 gross margins are likely to be slightly ahead of last year . The company said full-year pre-tax profit would be at the upper end of forecasts , currently between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m . Mr Bish-Jones said : "" It was a pretty difficultChristmas out there but our margin was up and sales held up pretty well . I think if you compare us with the rest of the retail pack we are pretty well in the middle . "" But as for the outlook , Mr Bish-Jones was downbeat . "" The downturn is likely to last at least 12 more months and we will plan for that . "" Woolworths also gave details of another IFRS adjustment on property leases . About Pounds 17m is coming off profit before exceptional items and amortisation in 2005-06 , which was much larger than expected .

4-08-2006,25,"Balancing Barclays LOMBARD - ANDREW HILL Barclays yesterday showed off Frits Seegers , whom analysts have dubbed its new "" gorilla "" in the boardroom . The former Citigroup executive , hired on an Pounds 11.7m package as head of global retail and commercial banking , comes with a fearsome reputation . He is viewed as a counterbalance on the board to the growing influence of Bob Diamond , the bank 's president . Earnings growth at Barclays certainly looks increasingly lopsided . Bob Diamond 's empire - Barclays Capital , Barclays Global Investors and wealth management - reported another stellar first-half performance , with Barcap raising profits by 66 per cent . Mr Diamond 's operations now account for 45 per cent of bank profits . But with Barclays increasingly reliant on cyclical investment banking revenues , investors will want to see some growth in the UK bank . Profits at the retail bank rose 12 per cent to Pounds 612m . However , problems remain . Net new mortgage lending was negative in the first quarter . At Barclaycard , profits fell 14 per cent to Pounds 297m due to rising bad debts . Yesterday Mr Seegers said he agreed with the existing strategy devised by Deanna Oppenheimer , still head of retail banking , to revive the UK business . But increasingly it looks as though Mr Seegers has been hired to do a much bigger job - which includes identifying suitable growth opportunities and acquisitions , perhaps overseas . That would be putting the cart before the horse . The performance of the UK bank , disproportionately important to investors , helps drive the group 's share rating ; the rating determines whether such deals can be done . Barclays has been the worst-performing UK bank stock over the past three months . Its shares trade at a price of 8.8 times forecast earnings for 2008 . That is still a slight premium to the sector , but the relatively poor recent performance partly reflects fears that Barclays may make a big acquisition that could destroy value . The more Mr Seegers learns about the job , the trickier it must seem .",balancing barclays lombard - andrew hill
6-10-2011,27,"Banking setbacks overshadow Tesco profit General retailers Tesco revealed that its push into financial services had suffered twin setbacks on Wednesday , casting a shadow over a 12 per cent increase in first-half profit achieved in the face of tough UK trading conditions . The retailer took a pound(s)57m ( $88m ) charge to cover alleged mis-selling of payment protection insurance , a controversial form of loan cover that has become an industry-wide scandal . Philip Clarke , chief executive , also said a small number of customers of Tesco Bank had not been able to access their savings accounts for a few days in June due to a technical glitch . "" It was very regrettable , "" Mr Clarke said . Following the problem , Tesco said it would take longer to complete the introduction of technical systems and would also delay the roll-out of new financial products . Clive Black and Darren Shirley , analysts at Shore Capital , said the "" unwelcome surprises "" at the banking arm undermined good news elsewhere in the results , saying UK profits and Asian performance had been better than expected . Pre-tax profit from continuing operations in the 26 weeks to August 27 was pound(s)1.88bn , up 12 per cent from a year earlier . Sales rose 8 per cent to pound(s)31.8bn. Trading profit at Tesco 's UK supermarket arm - by far the biggest part of the group - rose 5 per cent to pound(s)1.27bn on sales that rose 6 per cent to pound(s)21.2bn. However , when new stores were stripped out , sales were down 0.5 per cent for the half , excluding petrol sales and sales tax fluctuations . This like-for-like sales decline accelerated over the period , hitting 0.9 per cent in the second quarter after a drop of 0.1 per cent in the first quarter . Sales of "" non-food "" items such as electrical goods were particularly weak . Mr Clarke cited high petrol prices as a "" pernicious "" pressure on UK households . Tesco announced a pound(s)500m price-cutting campaign last month in a bid to revitalise its UK business . The retailer said the discounts would mean its UK profits would be broadly flat in the second half . Trading profit rose 19 per cent year on year to pound(s)292m in Asia - aided by strong growth in China and Thailand - and increased 12 per cent to pound(s)237m in continental Europe . The loss at Tesco 's Fresh & Easy arm in the US eased 23 per cent to pound(s)73m . The trading profit posted by Tesco 's banking arm fell 66 per cent year on year to pound(s)44m after the pound(s)57m PPI charge , which was in addition to a previous pound(s)35m provision . The delay to the systems migration and product launches meant Tesco Bank 's trading profit in the second half would be pound(s)40m less than it had been targeting , the company said . Diluted earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 17.9p , while an interim dividend of 4.63p per share has been declared , up 6 per cent . www.ft.com / lex Credit : By Adam Jones in London",banking setbacks overshadow tesco profit
28-05-2005,29,"Banks start to feel the strain of consumer debt Bad debt provisions may have to be raised as HSBC follows Barclays in highlighting a rise in the number of bad loans , writes Jane Croft Yesterday , HSBC became the second bank in as many days to warn of a "" marked "" increase in UK consumer bad debts . The move came after Barclays , the UK 's third-largest bank , warned that it had seen a "" significant "" rise in bad debt losses at its credit card business in the first quarter . With consumer borrowing at record highs and individual insolvencies running 44 per cent above their previous peak in the early 1990s , it was only a question of when the growing strain on over-indebted consumers would start to spill over into the banking sector in the form of higher bad debt provisions . Fuelled by low interest rates and unemployment , total lending to individuals has more than doubled since 1997 to more than Pounds 1,000bn . The ratio of personal borrowing to income doubled between 1995 and 2003 and the average level of outstanding consumer credit increased from Pounds 2,088 in 1995 to Pounds 6,464 in 2003 . Deutsche Bank says UK non-mortgage lending accounts for 20 per cent of household debt with about two-thirds of this in personal loans and a third in credit cards . The high street banks argue they have become better at lending and identifying which customers will default on loans . They have deployed computer screening techniques and behavioural modelling to design loans for consumers who would once have been deemed too risky . This appeared to have paid off . Arrears have been low and the UK banks reported combined profit of Pounds 30bn last year partly from increased sales of mortgages , credit cards and loans . However , even though unemployment remains low , this week 's statements by Barclays and HSBC show that some UK consumers have overstretched themselves . There have already been some high-profile tragedies , such as that of Stephen Lewis , a father-of-two who killed himself after running up Pounds 70,000 of debt on 19 credit cards . The Treasury select committee recently found that 178 consumers attending one debt advice charity had more than 16 credit cards and 815 people owed more than Pounds 100,000 each . About 2,322 people had debts of more than five times their annual income . Nick Lord , analyst at Deutsche Bank , says : "" There is no doubt that consumers who have become overstretched are suddenly finding it more difficult to meet their borrowing commitments . "" Naguib Kheraj , Barclays finance director , pointed out this week that some consumers were already feeling the strain from five successive interest rate rises in 18 months . He blamed a number of factors , including higher levels of consumer debt as well as higher utility and council tax bills . As a result , headline profit in UK retail banking will be lower than last year . "" None of these changes are dramatic but , with higher levels of indebtedness , there is more sensitivity to small changes in household cash flow , "" Mr Kheraj said . Analysts are most worried about bad debts rising at banks that have been aggressively growing unsecured loans and credit cards such as HBOS , Lloyds TSB , Royal Bank of Scotland and Egg . Bank of England figures show that Pounds 54bn of debt is now owed on credit cards . But bad debts are growing : banks wrote off Pounds 1.6bn of credit card debts in 2004 against Pounds 1bn in 2002 . Jonathan Pierce , banks analyst at CSFB , expects arrears levels to be higher on mortgages and unsecured credit when banks report their first half figures in August . "" Mortgage arrears tend to worry the general market observer and can have an impact on share prices . Unsecured arrears tend to hit profits . This is the area we are most concerned about . "" For the moment , mortgage arrears remain low : only 6,320 houses were repossessed last year compared with 78,000 in 1991 . But the number of people in arrears is rising for the first time since 1998 . The latest figures show that nearly 54,000 households are three to six months in arrears , a rise of 5,000 on a year ago .",banks start to feel the strain of consumer debt bad debt provisions may have to be raised as hsbc fo

Barclays was among the sharpest fallers after its house broker voiced concerns about a potential cash call . Jonathan Pierce , Credit Suisse analyst , said Barclays could need to raise pound(s)17bn over the next three years to meet new capital requirements . Under the current proposals Barclays ' equity tier one capital ratio - a key measure of balance sheet strength - would fall from 9.6 per cent currently to about 5 per cent , Credit Suisse forecast . Mr Pierce said : "" By selling 50 per cent of its BlackRock stake , and capping growth and dividends , we think the bank can manage this internally . "" Managing capital internally might , though , be sub-optimal given the growth opportunities , and we would not rule out an equity issue at some point . "" Barclays closed down 1.8 per cent to 312p , matching a weak trend among its peers following mixed results from Citigroup . Lloyds Banking Group was the sharpest Footsie faller , off 2.6 per cent to 57p . HSBC edged 0.1 per cent lower at 698 1/4 p following a downgrade to "" underperform "" from Exane BNP Paribas . Exane argued that , while HSBC was likely to outperform only in a double-dip recession , the domestic banks would benefit from any speed of recovery either through a rebound in economic growth or continued low interest rates . Drugs stocks helped the wider market trend , with the FTSE 100 reversing an initial decline to end up 18.75 points , or 0.3 per cent higher at 5,513.14. That put the index within 25 points of its recent high . The drugmakers found support after opinion polls suggested the Democrats could lose their key majority in the US Senate , which would make it harder for Barack Obama to pass a healthcare reform bill . GlaxoSmithKline gained 1.9 per cent at pound(s)12.84 1/2 and AstraZeneca closed higher by 1.7 per cent at pound(s)30.67 1/2 .

Goldman favoured Prudential , down 0.2 per cent at 613 1/2 p. Upgrading the stock to "" buy "" , Goldman argued that a pick-up in Asian mergers and flotations this year would help provide a benchmark to value Prudential 's growth businesses in Indonesia , India and Vietnam .

JPMorgan said : "" All luxury goods companies that have reported holiday sales to date have surprised on the upside "" .

11-11-2009,33,"BarCap spoiler at the Barclays party News analysis ; Investor reaction focused on a 31 per cent revenue decline at the investment banking division , writes Patrick Jenkins Shares in Barclays , the UK 's second-largest bank by market capitalisation , fell 5 per cent yesterday in spite of healthy profits for the third quarter , an improved assessment of the outlook for loan losses and the reinstatement of its dividend after almost a year . Analysts said the decline was a reaction to the one-third quarter-on-quarter fall in investment banking revenue to pound(s)3.7bn , although the Barclays Capital business , which was beefed up through the acquisition of the US operations of Lehman Brothers , contributed a third of group profits . Huw van Steenis , analyst at Morgan Stanley , said : "" BarCap had a strong start to the year but revenue has now fallen more sharply than at its peers , who were down by an average of just 4 per cent . What everyone is wondering now is what a good investment bank will make in 2010 . "" Regulatory reforms , which will require banks to hold greater amounts of capital , are set to restrict bank profits in future , particularly in riskier areas of investment banking . Chris Lucas , Barclays finance director , said yesterday that its 8.9 per cent core tier one capital ratio - the key measure of capital strength - would be closer to 8.2 or 8.3 per cent once the new regulatory demands were factored in . Barclays said pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of September were pound(s)1.56bn , compared with pound(s)1.61bn in the second quarter and pound(s)2.8bn a year ago . BarCap generated pound(s)568m of the total . That was aided by the decision to shift $12bn ( pound(s)7.2bn ) of legacy assets off the balance sheet to Protium , a new business run by former Barclays staff . However , it suffered a pound(s)405m loss on its own debt , using the fair value measure . BarCap also became less efficient , with the cost-income ratio rising from 75 per cent in the first half of the year to about 85 per cent , reflecting in large part the aggressive expansion of the group 's equities operation in Europe . The group said it was too early to say how large the bonus payments would be for BarCap 's employees , dodging one of the most contentious issues facing the world 's banks . Barclays is to pay a 1p dividend , the first since the final of 2008 was passed , from earnings per share of 7.8p. Mr Lucas said the payout ratio would be higher in future , but would remain substantially below the 50 per cent that Barclays has traditionally distributed . "" It 's very clear we want to be prudent in terms of the ratio , "" he said . In another sign of improving confidence , management said impairments on the troubled loans that sit on the bank 's books are likely to peak in the first quarter of next year , rather than towards the middle of the year as previously expected . For the overall group , the nine-month annualised loan loss rate was 136 basis points , against 144 basis points for the first half of the year . But Mr Lucas warned that the pound(s)1.65bn taken in impairment charges and other credit-related costs in the third quarter , down from pound(s)2.2bn in the second quarter of the year and pound(s)2.3bn in the first quarter , should not be seen as a clear trend . Impairments were likely to show a seasonal rise in the fourth quarter , he said . For the full year , the total figure would be closer to pound(s)9bn than the previously guided range of up to pound(s)9.6bn.

28-07-2012,35,"Barclays ' bad month capped by double blow banks Barclays was thrust into fresh controversy yesterday after the bank revealed the double blow of a regulatory inquiry into its finance director and a pound(s)450m charge for potential mis-selling to small business customers . The disclosures followed a turbulent month for Barclays in which three senior executives resigned over the bank 's involvement in the Libor rigging scandal . Marcus Agius , the outgoing chairman , reiterated his regret over the recent events , saying that he "" recognised that we have disappointed our customers and shareholders "" . But Mr Agius was immediately forced to defend Barclays in the face of the two new setbacks . Barclays said that the new regulatory investigation involved Chris Lucas , the finance director , and three other current and former employees . Three people familiar with the affair said the investigation extended to Roger Jenkins , the former head of the bank 's tax advisory business , who masterminded a contentious capital raising led by the Qatar Investment Authority in 2008 . The investigation centres on whether there was appropriate disclosure of fees paid by Barclays to the Qatar Investment Authority , the emirate 's sovereign wealth fund , when it made the investment . Barclays shares shrugged off the bad news yesterday rising 9 per cent to pound(s)1.67 as investors focused on the better than expected underlying performance in the first six months of 2012 . The bank said first-half headline pre-tax profits fell 71 per cent to pound(s)759m . Part of that decline was because of the newly quantified cost of compensating small and medium-sized businesses that had been mis-sold interest rate hedging products . Barclays was one of four banks to agree a settlement with the Financial Services Authority , the City regulator , last month over the mis-selling of interest rate swaps to SMEs . Yesterday it took a pound(s)450m provision related to the "" review and redress exercise "" agreed with the FSA , although it said that pound(s)100m of this was expected to unwind eventually . The steep fall in Barclays ' statutory pre-tax profit was mainly attributable to a pound(s)2.95bn "" own credit "" accounting loss on the fluctuating value of its issued debt . It also had to absorb an already announced pound(s)300m charge related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance . However , on an underlying basis that excludes the "" own credit "" accounting distortion and other items , first-half pre-tax profit rose 13 per cent to pound(s)4.23bn , ahead of analysts ' average forecast of pound(s)3.82bn. Barclays ' investment banking business , particularly its fixed-income division , did better than rivals with revenue up 5 per cent and costs down 3 per cent .

23-10-2008,37,"Barclays ' bond Sometimes , symbolism is what counts . Barclays is the first UK bank to test the market 's appetite for the government 's guarantee of bank debt . The UK banking fraternity could not allow this to be a damp squib . A lot is riding on the the knock-on effects this guarantee will , it is hoped , provide - less hysteria in money markets and more confidence in banks ' ability to procure term funding . So British banks should be relieved to see Barclays ' EUR3bn three-year bond deal get away . There are few ways institutional investors can get their hands on debt both guaranteed by the UK government and denominated in euros , which helped demand . Barclays also gathered a cast of thousands ( well , five other banks ) to make a market in the bonds , thereby ensuring their liquidity . For Barclays , the debt works out cheaper than if it had gone it alone , assuming it could have issued unguaranteed bonds of that maturity anyway . True , Lloyds TSB did a bond issue last week without guarantee . But it was smaller and the maturity longer , both important in current markets that unusually ascribe more credit risk to banks near-term than further out . Is there a risk banks will become reliant on government-guaranteed ( also called agency ) debt ? The question may seem a bit of a luxury , given that only 10 days ago banks could not get more than overnight funding . The issue could resolve itself anyway as rising agency issuance will cause spreads to widen , making it a less cost-effective option for banks . In any case , the pound(s)250bn in government guarantees is not that big a number compared with the vast money markets and retail deposits . The point of the guarantee is not to substitute for such regular sources of bank funding but rather to provide a breather until normal service resumes . Still , as symbols go , this one is a pretty powerful one .",barclays' bond
3-08-2013,39,"Barclays ' cash call Barclays said this week that it plans to raise pound(s)5.8bn via a rights issue in September , writes Jonathan Eley . It needs the money in order to comply with new regulations on capital and leverage . Rights issues give existing shareholders the opportunity to buy new shares in proportion to their existing holdings , usually at a discounted price . If they do not wish to take up their rights , they can sell them to someone else through a stockbroker . Barclays will offer one new share for every four existing ones at 185p a share , a 40 per cent discount to the market price before the announcement . Further details will be made available in September . Dividends will be held in respect of this financial year , so shareholders should receive a 1p per share interim dividend in September , another 1p in early December and a 3.5p final dividend next March . Thereafter , dividends will be 40-50 per cent of post-tax earnings - compared to 15-20 per cent now . Analysts were surprised by the size of the rights issue , but said it would put the bank on a firmer footing . "" We see the investment case of Barclays , once the rights issue has subsided , as attractive , "" said Ed Salvesen at Brewin Dolphin , who advises taking up the rights .

22-01-2011,41,"Barclays ' fine makes further penalties likely Investment advice ; Description of funds is at the heart of sales failings . Alice Ross reports The record fine imposed on Barclays this week is not expected to be the last for the industry , as the market downturn of 2008-09 has revealed that many private investors did not realise the risks attached to funds they were sold . Barclays was fined for faults in its investment advice after the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) uncovered "" serious failings "" in its sales processes . Its in-house sales advisers did not make sure that the funds were suitable for its customers - many of whom were retired or approaching retirement . But the fine , the biggest so far , is not the first to emerge from the wake of the credit crunch . While Barclays was not accused of misselling funds - a more serious charge that involves actively misleading consumers rather than failing to inform them - RSM Tenon was fined by the FSA last year for misselling structured products , while Keydata was put into administration by the FSA in 2009 after misselling funds . Fiona Fry , a regulatory partner at KPMG , said she was seeing more investigations around sales and complaints about products , meaning that the Barclays fine was "" likely to be followed by more fines for other organisations "" . Some advisers and fund managers believe that part of the problem in explaining risks to investors lies in the name of the product . Adrian Lowcock at financial advisory group Bestinvest said : "" Cautious may well mean something entirely different to two people , so one investor may find a cautious fund appropriate while another sees it as too risky . "" The FSA is aware of the problem of how funds are named and the Investment Management Association is conducting a review of some of its sectors . However , others believe the problem lies more in the way advice is given . Banks frequently sell investment products , often from insurance companies , in their branches through "" tied "" advisers - who do not advise on the whole market but instead just sell a limited range of products . An upcoming ban on allowing financial advisers to take commission is not expected to change this model . While bank advisers will have to make their charges clear to consumers , Patrick Connolly of AWD Chase de Vere warned that "" there is a risk that many typical bank and building society customers may not be not be financially knowledge-able , may not shop around and may not understand if they are getting a competitive deal "" . But banks will have to ensure that their advisers understand the products they are selling , which could lessen the problem that the name of the fund could mislead the investor . "" If funds are being sold properly , then the description is actually less important - as the adviser would understand the fund correctly and advise clients appropriately , "" said Danny Cox , head of financial advice at Hargreaves Lansdown .

Britain 's Financial Services Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission have to approve the proposed move , which will see the Dutch central bank take the lead in overseeing what will be one of the world 's largest financial institutions . Barclays has not yet had detailed discussions with the FSA about its proposed move and is likely to demand more information before making its decision . The FSA is expected to insist that the change of regulator should only go ahead if day-to-day control of the combined bank will be handled from Amsterdam . Barclays has agreed to move its corporate headquarters to Amsterdam as a concession to win agreement from ABN Amro . But it is unclear whether the bank 's senior management will be based in Amsterdam and some observers suspect the move is a ceremonial one . "" The issue about who will be the lead regulator has to do with where the corporate management of the combined bank is , "" said one person close to the FSA .

22-08-2012,47,"Barclays ' SA stake poised for expansion BANKS ; Radical overhaul of African operations Barclays is planning a radical overhaul of its African retail banking businesses that could lead to it taking a significantly larger stake in Absa , the South African lender it already controls . The bank , which paid $4.5bn for a majority stake in Absa in 2005 , is proposing to merge most of its own-branded African operations into the Johannesburg-based group . The move would help fulfil Barclays ' ambition to more closely align Absa with operations elsewhere . Barclays said it was in discussions to wrap its subsidiaries in Ghana , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia and the Indian Ocean into Absa . Its majority stakes in businesses in Kenya and Botswana would also be included , but retain their listings in each country . If the merger succeeds , Barclays is expected to receive payment in cash or shares from Absa to reflect the fact that it would essentially be handing over its own-branded businesses . Bob Diamond , the former chief executive , had indicated that the bank would like to increase its stake in Absa to about 75 per cent . Barclays is unlikely to be able to take full control as local laws protect the rights of minority investors . It is also likely to retain the Barclays brand outside South Africa , having made a significant investment into the business in recent years . The bank cautioned that discussions were at an early stage with no certainty they would lead to an integration . If an agreement was reached , any merger would not complete until 2013 . Barclays makes 5-10 per cent of its pre-tax profits from the African retail market and Mr Diamond had highlighted the region as a crucial area for growth . Absa had a sharp fall in profits in the first half of this year following a jump in credit impairments on South African mortgages and adverse currency movements . In June it issued a profit warning highlighting a rise in bad debt charges . One banking analyst suggested the move to restructure the business was a "" smoke and mirrors exercise aimed at hiding the large loan losses in Absa "" . But Maria Ramos , chief executive of Absa Group and Barclays Africa , said it was the "" next logical step "" in delivering the "" One Africa "" strategy announced last year . Barclays shares rose 2.2 per cent to 197p .

27-01-2011,49,"Barclays ' shift from branch advice marks industry sea change Banks ; News analysis ; A commission ban and rising costs will hit profitability , say Alice Ross and Sharlene Goff Barclays is to stop offering customers financial advice at its branches , shutting down its financial planning arm and putting 1,000 jobs at risk . In a sign of the changing landscape for financial advice in the UK , Barclays said the profitability of its financial planning business had been falling over recent years . The bank entered consultations with employees in Barclays Financial Planning on Wednesday to shut the unit down . The move will make it the first high street bank to stop offering consumers financial advice ahead of the Financial Services Authority 's ban on commission from 2013 . This sweeping reform of the financial advice industry , known as the retail distribution review , is expected to ramp up the costs of giving advice and will mean that many mass market consumers will not be able to afford a financial adviser . Banks are already facing tough new measures from the UK regulator to improve the way consumer products are sold following a string of investment scandals . These could go as far as banning some retail financial products or imposing caps on the level of fees providers can charge . But they also face a squeeze from the regulator on their in-house advisers . As part of the retail distribution review , advisers will have to take exams to be better qualified , incurring training costs . The big high street banks have long relied on a network of branch-based sales advisers to push financial products such as savings accounts , basic investments such as ISAs and pensions to existing customers . But while these provided a lucrative source of revenue for the banks when stock markets were rising and saving rates were high , demand from consumers has waned since the financial crisis . Low-cost products such as stakeholder pensions , which charge lower commissions and are less profitable for advisers , have also contributed to shrinking margins . Meanwhile , tighter regulation and an explosion of online information have further diminished the attractiveness of in-house financial advisers . "" Activity levels have dropped and regulatory costs have gone up - there is really not a lot of value in these any more , "" said one analyst . Other banks , however , say that they remain committed to their financial advisory businesses . Santander , which saw investment sales double between 2007 and 2009 to pound(s)3.5bn , and Royal Bank of Scotland are both investing heavily to train their branch-based advisers to the new level required under the retail distribution review . "" We are committed to delivering financial planning and ensuring our staff are fully trained to meet the changing needs of our customers , "" said RBS . But many fear the move away from commission is likely to create an "" advice gap "" in the UK , with less affluent consumers likely to be unable to afford financial advice . They are expected to turn to online "" execution-only "" services . Both banks and financial advice groups such as Hargreaves Lansdown are hoping to profit from this move . Barclays launched an online service for customers last November , and said it expects this business to grow as customers move online . Banks are also increasingly siphoning off their richer customers to specialist wealth arms that provide high-end financial advice . Global assets under management at the wealth operations of HSBC , Barclays , RBS and Lloyds Banking Group grew 35 per cent from $462bn to $624bn between 2004 and 2009 , according to wealth consultants Scorpio Partnership . Banks are not alone in trying to target more lucrative wealthier customers . Towry , the wealth manager and financial adviser , last autumn shut down the accounts of 6,000 of its clients who held less than pound(s)100,000 , arguing that giving financial advice below this level was no longer viable commercially . Barclays said the decision to shut down Barclays Financial Planning was not related to its record pound(s)7.7m fine incurred last week from the FSA , after advisers in the arm did not properly explain the risks of funds they had sold to elderly clients .

ABN has faced mounting pressure from hedge funds to sell off non- core assets as they believe the bank 's restructuring and acquisitive strategy has done little to boost the share price .

30-11-2010,53,"Barclays ' misled ' Italian bank on CDOs ' risk , court hears Banks Barclays "" misled "" an Italian bank when it sold complex debt products that were "" much riskier "" than the triple A credit rating they had been given , the High Court was told on Monday . The UK bank is being sued by Cassa di Risparmio di San Marino bank , which is seeking EUR92m ( pound(s)78m ) in losses and lost income alleging fraudulent misrepresentation over the sale of ultra complex collaterised debt obligations ( CDOs ) . Barclays denies the allegations . The case is one of a number of actions faced by banks over complex credit products that have triggered widespread losses in the financial industry . George Leggatt QC , representing San Marino , told the High Court the Italian bank "" thought they were getting a safe investment with a low chance of loss "" , but he claimed that the underlying assets within the CDO squared were "" much riskier "" . "" Barclays designed an asset which instead of being safer than the reference assets was actually much riskier , "" he said , adding one expert had called this "" credit rating arbitrage "" . The court was told the CDO designed by Barclays was given a triple A rating by the rating agencies , suggesting the probability of default was assessed at a "" fraction of 1 per cent "" . However , the court heard that Barclays and other experts calculated the probability of default was "" of a different order "" at 25 per cent or more . Mr Leggatt said that "" Barclays misled San Marino as to the implication of the AAA rating "" . "" If you have deliberately structured the product to achieve a different risk , we say you have crossed the line into misrepresentation and potentially deceit , "" he said . "" The wrong comes we say , the moment you start to exploit the rating in order to sell the product knowing the investor is relying on the rating . . . and believes the product has a low risk of default . "" Barclays said it was "" defending itself vigorously "" against the allegations , which it believed were without merit .

1-05-2010,55,"Barclays Barclays ' first-quarter profit surged by almost 47 per cent , yet its shares slid by more than 6 per cent yesterday . In part , the strong fixed income , currencies and commodities ( FICC ) performances from Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank had stoked expectations that Barclays Capital would also shoot the lights out . But instead , BarCap 's revenue was down 26 per cent on last year , and top-line income from FICC was almost 40 per cent lower , compared with the roughly 10 per cent fall at other investment banks . Credit Suisse 's recent first-quarter results disappointed for much the same reason . But investors ' concerns about Barclays do not end there . Although Barclays ' pre-tax profits rose by 47 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , helped by a sharp fall in impairments , BarCap accounted for more than four-fifths of them . Retail banking still struggles . This was not as lop-sided as Deutsche Bank , where investment banking contributed 93 per cent of pre-tax profits , but does little to dispel investor concerns that Barclays relies unduly on volatile investment banking . Barclays itself targets a one-third / two-thirds split between BarCap 's and the retail bank 's share of profit . Given that the market conditions of the first two quarters of last year are unlikely to be repeated , another way to see BarCap 's revenue decline is as setting a more normal quarterly run-rate of pound(s)3.5bn-pound(s)4bn , Credit Suisse notes . That might herald the greater balance that Barclays seeks . Yet BarCap , after a costly hiring spree , insists its latest performance represents a baseline . Either way , investors are not convinced : Barclays ' shares , at about 0.8 times book value , trade at a dismal discount even to part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group , a pure retail banking play on the UK 's fragile recovery . For all its sparkle , BarCap does nothing for Barclays ' rating .",barclays
22-02-2006,57,"Barclays For a bank that has had a tricky year in its core UK retail business , Barclays ' 15 per cent jump in full year pre-tax profits looks impressive . This does not mean that all in the domestic garden is rosy : performance was shored up by strong earnings growth at Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm , and BGI , the global fund management business . And , excluding its South African acquisition Absa , growth drops to 8 per cent . But the impetus of these businesses gives credibility to the target of producing a 50:50 split between UK and international profits in the next three years , even without further acquisitions . Building profitability at Barclays Capital while continuing to invest heavily is no mean feat , and reflects the clever product mix devised by its chief executive , Robert Diamond . However , Barclays will not be able to rely on this level of profitability in a market downturn , and the business may have to prove it can shrink as nimbly as it has grown . There is still the prospect that Barclays might sort out its UK retail business . A rise in bad debt provisions helped depress earnings on Barclaycard , but that trend should slow this year . Management also reports that operational problems that have contributed to its disappointing performance in mortgages have been tackled ( by bringing some outsourced processing in-house ) . But investing further in the UK retail business while improving its cost/ income ratio represents a challenge . Barclays still has to prove it can turn the corner in the UK . But the hope that there will be scope to buy back shares later this year once Tier-one capital level , depleted by last year 's acquisition , has been restored to its target level of 7.25 per cent , should be enough to entice investors .",barclays
28-04-2011,59,"Barclays Barclays Capital 's strength is as a debt house . Yet the investment bank 's fixed income , commodities and currencies unit has delivered a lacklustre performance in the first quarter . Revenue fell by more than a fifth from a year ago to pound(s)2.1bn. Its equity business , comprising the former northern American operations of Lehman Brothers , also disappointed , achieving only an 11 per cent increase in revenue for a business that must bear heavy hiring costs . Overall , BarCap 's revenue fell 15 per cent from a year ago . Investors , spooked both by the outlook for the business that delivers the bulk of Barclays ' profits and by doubts over the group 's ability to increase return on equity , marked down the shares by 4.2 per cent . Bob Diamond , chief executive , acknowledged their concern in February when he cut Barclays ' return on equity target to 13 per cent by 2013 . Given the 8.1 per cent achieved in the normally strong first quarter , that looks like a stretch . But he has made a start : costs were flat , BarCap cut credit market exposures and Barclays sold property . The bank will also restructure its loan to the Protium Finance vehicle into which it tipped $12.3bn of illiquid loans in 2009 , a conjuring trick that was supposed to tune out mark-to-market earnings volatility . Conditions have improved since . But the real reason for that deal is that looming Basel III reforms would force Barclays to hold more capital against its Protium loan . It now hopes to boost overall returns by taking back ownership of the assets and running them off pronto . With Protium , Barclays has reminded investors that it is , in effect , just another UK bank restructuring play . Given the uncertain outlook for BarCap and pressure to meet higher regulatory capital requirements , the current share price , at 0.84 times book value , looks about right .",barclays
31-07-2013,61,"Barclays Is that it , then ? Can we stop talking about Barclays ' capital now ? Chief executive Antony Jenkins will hope so . Yesterday 's pound(s)5.8bn rights issue will go a long way towards plugging the bank 's pound(s)12.8bn capital hole . Retained earnings and balance sheet shrinkage will also help . It is a big cash call , equivalent to 15 per cent of the market capitalisation . But if it puts an end to the uncertainty on capital , it will be worth the effort . Whether pound(s)5.8bn is enough depends on the definition of enough . It fulfils the latest regulatory requirements . Barclays ' leverage ratio ( capital as a proportion of total assets ) of 2.2 per cent falls short of what regulators want . The latest plan will get the bank to its 3 per cent target by next June . And it has good reason to raise only what it needs . As it is , the bank has delayed the date when its return on equity will beat its 11.5 per cent cost of equity by a year to 2016 . But that does not mean Barclays ' capital concerns have disappeared . Regulatory demands are fluid , as the latest enthusiasm for leverage ratios demonstrates . Earnings recovery , and the ability to generate capital internally , could take longer than expected - earnings forecasts for 2013 are a fifth lower than they were two years ago . The drip-drip of conduct issues continues , with another pound(s)2bn of provisions taken in the first half of 2013 . Yet despite this uncertainty Barclays has become more generous on dividends , pledging to pay more , and sooner . The sugar rush of the dividend promise sweetens the bitter pill of the rights issue , but will make Mr Jenkins ' life more difficult if he needs more capital later . As it is , the bank is taking money from investors only to return some of it next year . Barclays has taken a big step towards answering the questions about its capital . But other banks are in a more comfortable position . We can stop talking about Barclays ' capital for the moment , but do not be surprised if the chatter returns .",barclays
31-10-2013,63,"Barclays Let 's split Barclays into two . Into one bucket , put all of the corporate colour of the past couple of years - the Libor fine , the insurance mis-selling claims , the interest rate swap mis-selling claims , Bob Diamond 's departure , the pound(s)5.8bn rights issue , etc. Into the other put the actual operations , the humdrum business of taking deposits , lending and dealing in the financial markets . Over the past two years , the share price suggests that the two have cancelled each other out . At 274p , the shares are no higher than they were in mid-2011 despite the prospect of economic recovery . Yesterday 's third-quarter numbers show growth slowly coming through . Profits in UK retail banking were 18 per cent ahead of the average for the past eight quarters . Africa , Barclaycard and corporate banking also did better than the long-term average . Even the problematic European business managed to post a smaller loss than it usually does . The problem business in the third quarter was the investment bank , dragged back by a slowdown in fixed income trading . Profits from the division were pound(s)463m , 45 per cent below the average quarterly level over the past two years . If the shares are to push on from their rating of 0.9 times tangible book value , Barclays has to do two things . First , consign bucket one to history . Chief executive Antony Jenkins ' focus on ethics bodes well . But yesterday the bank said it was reviewing its foreign exchange business in the light of regulatory interest , so there is still potential for nasties lurking at the bottom . The second is to stop the investment bank from overshadowing recovery elsewhere . There should be news on that next year as Barclays reveals more detail on plans to shrink its balance sheet . Volatile , capital-intensive businesses such as fixed-income trading are likely to be in the line of fire .",barclays

22-10-2008,71,"Barclays announces bond plans BANKS ; Amount likely to be a benchmark EUR1bn ; Move follows pound(s)400m Lloyds deal Barclays has announced plans for the first public bond from a bank to benefit from UK government guarantees , setting the precedent for other British banks to access the capital markets using the guarantee . While the size of the deal is not set , it is likely to be a benchmark bond and could total close to EUR1bn ( pound(s)775m ) with a three-year maturity , one person with knowledge of the deal said . The guaranteeing of bank debt issuance was one of the central features of the UK government 's bail-out of the banking sector this month . Barclays is working with HSBC , Lloyds TSB , Royal Bank of Scotland , Santander and Standard Chartered in arranging the transaction , although Barclays will have sole control of book-running . The deal follows a pound(s)400m bond issue by Lloyds last week . That sale marked the first financial bond to be sold in the US or Europe since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in early September and one of the first bond sales of any kind in the past five weeks . However , unlike Barclays , it did not use the UK government guarantee . While the Barclays bond is the first public , syndicated UK government guaranteed bond from a bank , other institutions are believed to have used the guarantee to issue privately placed , much shorter-dated debt . RBS , for example , has issued several billion pounds of debt using the guarantee in the past few days , one person close to the bank said . The UK guarantee charges banks a fee based on a bank 's average premium in credit derivatives markets from October 2007 to October 2008 , plus a further 50 basis points . Analysts at Credit Suisse estimated the average credit default swap spread to be about 80 basis points . This fee will be applied to the principal amount of the bond . However , the government has said it may use its own estimate of an appropriate CDS spread if public data are not available and apply an incremental fee for non-sterling issuance that uses the guarantee . Barclays has denominated the bond issue in euros , as a result of feedback from investors , the person said . It is expected to carry a triple-A credit rating from all three main rating agencies . The rate of interest paid on the bond has still to be set . But initial discussions with investors indicate it could be about the level of 25 basis points over the London interbank offered rate , Libor , the rate at which banks lend to each other .

Several divisions , including UK retail banking , made less profit than in 2008 but profit at Barclays Capital rose 89 per cent to pound(s)2.46bn. Barclays also showed its more sensitive side . Marcus Agius , chairman , said banks must serve society . In this rare foray into a results announcement , he pointed up the scale of Barclays ' lending within the UK economy . Meanwhile , the two top executives - John Varley , chief executive , and Bob Diamond , group president - have declined annual bonuses for the second year running . The results vindicate Barclays ' decision to avoid direct government help , which would have hobbled it across a range of decisions . Even so , the performance was still aided by low central bank interest rates and implicit taxpayer guarantees that a bank this big would not be allowed to fail . Forgoing the bonuses was smart tactics , but will not end public anger over bankers ' pay . While the proportion of BarCap 's revenues spent on compensation may have dropped from 44 per cent to 38 per cent , attention will still focus on the average six-figure bonuses being paid . Sacrificing the annual bonus could even backfire , as it contrasts with the incentive packages that remain untouched ; and serves as a reminder that senior executives can afford the luxury of self-denial in a way that others can not . But the bonus restraint 's real purpose is to enable Barclays to be part of talks on the shape of banking . It argues , correctly , that forcing banks to adopt "" narrow "" business models will not make the system safer . Now , even though it would mean pain for bankers , Barclays should engage in the debate about devising a framework where big banks can safely fail . Having done so much to keep a seat at the table , the bank should make sure it has something worth saying .",barclays bounces
3-12-2009,79,"Barclays bounces back after soothing fears over BarCap LONDON Barclays was among the talking points yesterday as the FTSE 100 edged higher . The stock was in focus amid speculation that Barclays Capital , its investment banking division , had missed internal targets for November . Investors said Barclays management had been talking about an industry-wide trend of weak capital markets activity last month . Brokers including Redburn Partners reckoned the weakness made revenue guidance look a stretch . However , Chris Lucas , Barclays ' finance officer , told an investment conference in Paris that the bank remained comfortable with 2009 consensus forecasts . Mr Lucas flagged up recent "" seasonality "" at BarCap but maintained guidance for the division given at the half year . He also said the Dubai crisis provided no reason to change impairment guidance , helping Barclays shares rally from a 3.9 per cent intraday loss to close 0.5 per cent higher at 297 1/2 p. The rest of the financial sector was under pressure following a weak performance from Wall Street peers overnight , and ahead of the European Central Bank outlining today how it will scale back support measures . Traders also noted research from Credit Suisse arguing that the domestic lenders will face further capital pressures as risk assets such as equities are reweighted . Analyst Jonathan Pierce concluded that none of the UK banks looked cheap enough given the risk of further downgrades . Royal Bank of Scotland ended down 2.1 per cent at 33 1/2 p , while Lloyds Banking Group faded 1.8 per cent to 53.1p. Miners provided the foundation for the wider market , helping the FTSE 100 to gain 15.22 , or 0.3 per cent , to 5,327.39. Lonmin led blue-chip stocks higher , rising 3.2 per cent to pound(s)19.11 after Investec added the stock to its "" buy "" list based on management 's gradual turnround . "" We do see a risk that the recent platinum price rally could reverse . However , we believe the market is looking through near-term issues and is valuing Lonmin on its long-term potential , "" said Investec , which set a pound(s)20.75 price target . Vedanta Resources added 2.5 per cent to pound(s)24.45 on the back of a Goldman Sachs upgrade to "" buy "" . Goldman forecast metals prices to correct in the coming months , but argued that companies with production volume growth would be hedged against the correction . This led it to recommend Vedanta and Kazakhmys , up 2.3 per cent to pound(s)13.09. Anglo American edged up 0.3 per cent to pound(s)27.21 as Merrill Lynch ran the figures on a likely refinancing of its Anglo Platinum subsidiary early next year . It concluded that the removal of uncertainty should overshadow the cost . Energy stocks were weaker after an unexpected increase in US oil inventories sent crude prices sharply lower . BG Group was 0.8 per cent weaker at pound(s)11.20 1/2 and the B shares of Royal Dutch Shell fell 0.4 per cent to pound(s)17.64. Cairn Energy was the sharpest Footsie faller , down 2.6 per cent to pound(s)30.64. Research house Omni started coverage of the stock with a "" sell , "" arguing that exploration news would be sparse before 2011 and takeover theories looked doubtful . A short squeeze lifted Sage Group by 3 per cent to 221p after the software maker 's full-year results matched expectations . Following in-line results on Tuesday , Tui Travel rebounded by 2.1 per cent to 248 1/2 p as brokers including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch repeated "" buy "" advice . Vodafone rose 2.2 per cent to 143p after Credit Suisse raised its target price to 160p based on European trading beating expectations . Eaga led the mid-cap risers with a 4.8 per cent gain to 137 1/2 p after the UK government gave the green light to a pound(s)8.5bn "" smart meter "" programme . The heating installer is expected to be among the leading bidders for the work . Spice , up 0.7 per cent to 73p , is also expected to pitch . Among the fallers , Britvic eased 2.5 per cent to 389 3/4 p after its chief executive and finance director exercised and sold share options .

28-04-2011,81,"Barclays buys back $9bn portfolio of credit assets from former staff U-turn comes as bank posts 9 % fall in profits Barclays is buying back a troublesome $9.3bn ( pound(s)5.6bn ) portfolio of credit assets , codenamed Protium , 18 months after selling it to a fund dominated by former employees in an elaborate accounting manoeuvre designed to make its profits less volatile . The bank detailed the U-turn on Wednesday as it reported a 9 per cent fall in profits for the first quarter of 2011 . Barclays ' shares fell 4 per cent to 289.65p following the results . Analysts said the Protium affair had damaged Barclays ' reputation but the more concerning news was on the outlook for earnings . Barclays had said previously it was comfortable with analysts ' consensus expectations for pound(s)7bn of underlying pre-tax profit this year . But management said on Wednesday the number , while still correct , did not include an estimated pound(s)400m hit from a government levy on UK banks . "" Effectively that is a 6 per cent downgrade , "" said Simon Maughan , analyst at MF Global . Analysts said the 8.1 per cent return on equity for the three months to March was flattered by the non-inclusion of the levy hit and a pound(s)190m write-up of the value of Protium assets . They questioned the write-up , given that indices relating to underlying credit market assets fell in the first quarter . Barclays is taking back full ownership of the Protium assets from C12 , a spun-off entity created in September 2009 to wind down the portfolio over 10 years with the help of a $12.6bn loan from Barclays . The manoeuvre was designed to protect the bank from losses created by fluctuations in the market value of assets that remained illiquid after the financial crisis . But under new Basel III global rules , banks must hold more capital against loans of this type . Barclays will pay an $83m break fee to C12 . It has also agreed to buy out unidentified third-party investors in the fund for $270m . In addition , Barclays will invest $750m in another C12 credit fund called Helix . Barclays made a pre-tax profit of pound(s)1.66bn in the first quarter , down 9 per cent on the same period in 2010 . Stripping out the effect of acquisitions , disposals and fluctuations in the value of its own debt , adjusted pre-tax profit was pound(s)2bn , up 10 per cent .

14-11-2011,83,"Barclays calls for transparency Accounting rules need reform , executive says ; ' Fair value ' method distorts profit results Barclays ' finance director has called for an overhaul of "" opaque and complex "" accounting rules that artificially boosted the profits of big European and US banks by billions of pounds in the third quarter of this year . In a letter published in today 's Financial Times , Chris Lucas , group finance director , said the requirement for banks to adjust their figures to reflect the market value of their own debt was widely believed to distort their actual profits . "" It makes results difficult to explain to investors and is unhelpful for an industry that wants to rebuild confidence through transparency in financial reporting , "" he wrote . So-called "" fair value accounting of own debt "" means banks adjust their earnings to reflect the price at which they could buy back their debt in the market . If their debt is viewed as risky , meaning there is a higher chance of default , it is worth less , so banks could in theory buy it back more cheaply . Paradoxically , this means that in difficult market conditions , such as those in recent months , banks are able to book large artificial gains in their financial results . This accounting method was particularly flattering for big banks in the third quarter . Between them Barclays , HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland benefited from almost pound(s)10bn ( $16bn ) of one-off credit gains in the three months to September , compared with about pound(s)2.7bn of losses in the same period a year earlier . Five big US investment banks - Citigroup , Bank of America , JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - revealed gains equivalent to more than four-fifths of their combined $16bn in net profits for the third quarter . UBS , the Swiss bank hit by a $2.3bn alleged rogue-trading scandal , reported a net profit after a higher than expected SFr1.77bn ( pound(s)1.22bn ) credit gain bolstered its figures . Even though banks typically break out the credit gains , analysts said such distortions could still make it harder to assess their underlying performance . "" It is ludicrous that when [ credit ] spreads are widening and banks ' financial position deteriorates , the accounting means they book a profit on their debt , "" said one . Analysts expect credit gains to reverse next year as markets stabilise , leaving banks potentially facing large losses for the comparable period in 2012 . Not all banks use the fair value method - Standard Chartered said it did not account for swings in the value of its own credit . Once banks elect to value their debt in this way , they must continue to do so . Letters , Page 12 Credit : By Sharlene Goff , Retail Banking Correspondent",barclays calls for transparency
5-04-2011,85,"Barclays chief ready to increase risk appetite in search of profit Diamond set target of 13 % ROE by 2013 Bob Diamond has decided Barclays must increase its risk appetite amid internal bank expectations that a key measure of its profitability will stagnate or fall this year . Barclays ' chief executive is considering increasing the bank 's risk profile to hit profitability targets over the next three years , according to people familiar with the bank 's thinking . Mr Diamond , who began in his job in January , has set a target of achieving a 13 per cent return on equity by 2013 . But last year 's return on equity of 7.2 per cent is set to fall below 7 per cent this year in spite of deep cost cuts , according to people close to Barclays . Analysts had been projecting a steady improvement in profitability . Barclays is rethinking how much risk the bank should take on , at a time when regulators are urging bankers to be prudent after the financial crisis . Barclays ' "" daily value at risk "" metric , which models potential losses on its trading activities , has fallen by a half since the financial crisis . "" One of our challenges is that not enough risk is being taken , "" said a person familiar with the chief executive 's thinking . Deals to acquire credit market assets worth up to $20bn ( pound(s)12.4bn ) were possible , bankers said . There could be further credit card portfolio deals , similar to last month 's pound(s)2bn acquisition of the Egg business , and the pound(s)130m purchase on Monday of small business balances from MBNA . It recently emerged that Barclays had been looking at a $17bn deal to acquire assets previously carved out of US insurer AIG , though one person familiar with the portfolio said it was "" extremely unlikely "" Barclays would proceed with that . Mr Diamond set new profit targets in February , part of a strategic overhaul that identified a third of the group as insufficiently profitable . Since then , the outlook for Barclays Capital , the group 's profit driver , has grown worse . Although performance in January and February had been satisfactory , March had been weaker , bankers said .

15-11-2011,87,"Barclays counts cost of proposed ICB banking sector reforms LONDON Barclays was among the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 on Monday after Goldman Sachs said UK regulation would put lenders at an international disadvantage . Rules proposed by the Independent Commission on Banking will cost the industry around pound(s)9.6bn a year to implement , Goldman said . This "" could more than double the cost of post-crisis regulatory reform , "" said the broker . The commission 's estimate of costs of between pound(s)4bn and pound(s)7bn did not include the effect on funding of building a loss absorption buffer , in which losses have to fall on creditors in future bank insolvencies , Goldman argued . "" Barclays is most exposed to ICB reforms , "" Goldman said . "" We believe the combination of reduced returns and a smaller balance sheet could dramatically reduce Barclays ' earnings power . "" Shares in Barclays ended 2.7 per cent weaker at 174p after Goldman cut the stock to "" sell "" with a 200p target .

Noble posted mark-to-market losses on cotton and carbon credits , two markets where Glencore has little exposure , so analysts saw little direct read-across .

Smiths Group rose 0.8 per cent to 954 1/2 p on continued speculation that Apax may make a second bid for its medical business . Smiths shares have fallen 30 per cent since January , when the group rejected Apax 's pound(s)2.45bn bid for the unit . Having rallied nearly 40 per cent on Friday after directors bought stock , Premier Foods gave back 10.9 per cent to 5 3/4 p.

16-05-2008,89,"Barclays defends core capital ratio Barclays struck a defiant tone , arguing it had suffered less damage than some rival banks from the turmoil in the credit markets and did not need to boost its capital reserves significantly . Barclays executives yesterday said the bank was keeping all options open with regard to bolstering its capital ratios as it revealed it had written down the value of debt securities on its balance sheet by Pounds 1.7bn. However , the bank said it was standing by its previous target of a 5.25 per cent core Tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of balance sheet strength . Analysts and investors view the ratio as low when compared with rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland , which recently raised its target ratio to 6 per cent . Barclays ' core Tier 1 ratio at the end of March was 5.1 per cent and the bank indicated that this was likely to fall further by the end of June . Chris Lucas , finance director , refused to be drawn on how the bank would rebuild its capital but added : "" We would agree that regulators will be over time looking for higher capital ratios and looking for less leverage in institutions . That will be an industry-wide phenomenon and we will have to be part of that . "" Barclays ' position met with a sceptical response from analysts and investors , who believe the bank will be forced to hold much higher capital reserves . Last night Moody 's , the credit rating agency , downgraded the outlook for Barclays ' debt and deposit ratings , arguing that further writedowns were possible . "" According to Moody 's stress scenarios , the size and characteristics of some of ( Barclays ' ) structured credit product positions could result in further impairments or writedowns , "" the agency said . Barclays defended the level of writedowns , which are significantly lower than those taken by other banks with significant investment banking operations .

The UK 's third-largest high street bank also said operating costs in the third quarter rose across most of its business units as it continued to invest in fast-growing areas . These included Barclays Capital , its debt-focused investment bank , where 1,000 extra staff have been hired this year . Barclays expected pre-tax profit for 2005 will be "" broadly "" in line with market forecasts of Pounds 5.18bn. However , its shares fell 6 1/2p to 595 1/2p amid disappointment that the trading statement did not trigger profit forecast upgrades . One banking analyst said : "" It was a positive statement but there was a huge weight of expectations on Barclays . US investment banks have seen record profits in the third quarter and everyone expected that to translate through to Barclays Capital . "" Barclays Capital continued to deliver "" very strong profit growth "" helped by "" unusually "" high client activity in the third quarter . But operating expenses rose broadly in line with income due to increased staffing costs . Barclaycard also saw a growth in income but this was more than offset by investment in Juniper , its US card operation , and by continued bad debt charges . Naguib Kheraj , finance director , said rising bad debts had led Barclaycard , which has 11.2m customers , to be more stringent about its lending policies . The credit card division now rejects 55 per cent of new applications , up from 35 per cent at historic low points in the economic cycle . Mr Kheraj said : "" We have not changed our hurdle rate of return but we have changed our expectation of the average loss so that means we reject more customers . "" He added that there was "" not a big increase "" in the number of Barclaycard accounts in difficulty but the amounts owed on accounts in difficulty was "" higher than expected "" .

The San Marino-based bank is seeking damages of at least EUR170m ( pound(s)134m ) in losses and lost income related to five complex credit-linked notes bought by CRSM for EUR450m in 2004 and 2005 . It is also seeking unspecified damages related to the restructuring of three other complex notes in June 2005 . "" The legal action has no merit and we will contest it vigorously , "" Barclays said yesterday . The suit is part of an increasing number of actions faced by banks over their complex credit products since the market turmoil that began last year led to widespread losses in the financial industry . Lawyers said that many disgruntled clients are pursuing the banks that had arranged complex debt products , but that claims are mostly settled well before they near a court filing , which is seen very much as a last resort , particularly in Europe . Barclays has faced a number of similar lawsuits over collateralised debt obligations it has structured and sold . In 2005 it settled a $151m claim brought by HSH Nordbank of Germany . HSH is also currently suing UBS , the Swiss bank , over alleged mismanagement of a $500m portfolio of collateralised debt obligations to London . The case , which is set to be heard in New York , was among the first to be filed over subprime mortgage losses in the wake of the credit crunch . Barclays , meanwhile , is also named in a lawsuit filed this month by Oddo Asset Management of France in New York , which relates to two investment funds known as "" SIV-lites "" .

8-08-2008,95,"Barclays disposes of pound(s)6bn worth of loans banks ; Investors willing to buy difficult assets ; Lender scales back exposure to debt Barclays , the UK banking group , has offloaded troubled loans worth more than pound(s)6bn ( $11.7bn ) in the past few months in a further sign that investors are increasingly willing to buy debt securities hit by the credit crunch . Barclays executives yesterday said they had sold leveraged loans , mortgage-backed securities and mortgages with a value of pound(s)6.3bn in the first half of the year as part of an effort to scale back the bank 's exposure to troubled debt securities . Most of the sales , which were agreed in May and June , were at prices consistent with valuations on Barclays ' balance sheet , and did not require the bank to provide financing to buyers . The disposals are further evidence that banks are increasingly able to shift debt securities . "" Risk transfer has begun , "" Bob Diamond , Barclays ' president , said yesterday . "" Even difficult assets - even mortgage assets - are moving to new buyers . "" Last month Merrill Lynch sold collateralised debt obligations with a nominal value of more than $30bn to Lone Star , the US private equity group , at about 22 per cent of face value . In May UBS , the Swiss bank , sold mortgage securities with a face value of $22bn to BlackRock , the asset management group . In both cases the banks helped to finance the purchase . Barclays revealed the sales as the bank reported that it had written down the value of complex debt securities on its balance sheet by pound(s)2.8bn in the first half of the year . The writedown , which was partly offset by an pound(s)852m gain from revaluing the bank 's own debt , was largely responsible for the drop in the bank 's pre-tax profits , which fell 33 per cent to pound(s)2.75bn. Barclays has in recent months faced persistent questions about the valuation of debt securities on its balance sheet . The sales included the financing of about pound(s)2.3bn of loans backing the private equity buy-out of Alltel , the US telecom group . Alltel has since been sold to Verizon , its US rival , which redeemed the debts . Barclays has also sold whole subprime mortgage loans worth pound(s)828m , Alt-A mortgages worth pound(s)750m and commercial mortgages worth pound(s)700m . John Varley , Barclays ' chief executive , said he was disappointed by the results and the drop in the bank 's shares which , in spite of a recent rally , have lost almost half their value in the past 12 months . "" We will be working as hard as we can to ensure a higher valuation can be placed on our shares , "" he said . Barclays shares closed at 375p , up 6p , as the bank indicated it was likely to maintain its cash dividend payment for the full year .

3-08-2011,97,"Barclays driven by investment arm Barclays ' investment bankers contributed the bulk of the group 's first-half profits , as a pound(s)1bn bill for mis-sold loan insurance hampered its efforts to build up the retail business . Barclays Capital provided pound(s)2.4bn , or more than 90 per cent , of the bank 's pound(s)2.64bn pre-tax profit in the first six months . First-half profits at the investment banking division fell almost 30 per cent year-on-year , after revenues slipped at its core fixed-income , currency and commodities division . But a provision in the retail business for payment protection insurance , combined with a costly withdrawal from parts of its European branch network , meant that BarCap still accounted for a larger proportion of overall revenue than a year ago . Investors have criticised Barclays for its heavy reliance on investment banking , which has traditionally been seen as a riskier business . While Bob Diamond , chief executive , has privately moved away from previous targets to limit profit contribution from BarCap to a third , he still wants a more even split between retail and investment banking . He revealed on Tuesday that the bank would cut up to 3,000 jobs this year , most of which are expected to come in the investment banking arm as part of cost-cutting . So far 1,400 jobs have been eliminated this year . Overall pre-tax profits fell by a third in the first half , largely owing to the one-off PPI charge . Like other UK banks Barclays agreed to start refunding customers who were mis-sold PPI as a way to cover loan repayments if they fell ill or lost jobs . Stripping out the charge as well as accounting issues related to the value of its own debt , pre-tax profit rose 24 per cent to pound(s)3.68bn - of which 63 per cent came from BarCap . Analysts said that Barclays ' goal of generating a 13 per cent return on equity by 2013 looked ambitious . In the first half its ROE was 5.9 per cent , although this rose to 9.1 per cent excluding PPI and other charges . "" We think the targets will be a stretch , "" said one analyst . "" On our forecasts pre-tax profit would be pound(s)2bn short of where it needs to be in 2013 to meet the target returns . "" Revenue was relatively flat at Barclaycard and at the UK retail business , which along with BarCap are viewed by Mr Diamond as the bank 's three "" top tier "" businesses . At Barclays Wealth , hailed by Mr Diamond as a key growth area , pre-tax profits fell 7 per cent as investment in the business wiped out a 12 per cent increase in revenues . Meanwhile charges related to closing parts of the troubled Spanish business pushed the European operation into a pound(s)161m loss , compared with a pound(s)10m pre-tax profit a year ago .

6-03-2009,99,"Barclays drops 24 % on fresh concerns about writedowns LONDON Barclays slumped by 24 per cent yesterday on fresh concerns about its balance sheet strength . The stock tumbled after Panmure Gordon analyst Sandy Chen said credit writedowns might be about double the company 's current estimate . "" We expect Barclays will record major losses in 2009 and 2010 , "" he said . "" If corporate defaults jump and structured credits undergo another wave of downgrades , we think that the structure of swaps with monolines and other counterparties that Barclays put in place to limit losses could buckle . "" In its 2008 results , Barclays revealed net derivatives exposures had risen by pound(s)30bn , with about pound(s)21bn of swap contracts in place with monoline insurers . According to Mr Chen , such deals put Barclays at risk of "" double defaults "" , whereby the underlying assets default and counterparties including the monolines fail to honour their insurance commitment . He forecast Barclays to write down its credit portfolio by pound(s)13bn in 2009 and 2010 . The company currently targets pound(s)7bn-pound(s)8bn .

Barclays bought Lehman 's north American operations last year . The FTSE 100 dropped 3.2 per cent , down 116.01 points to 3,529.86. That all but erased the previous day 's rally from six-year lows . Aviva led the insurers into a tailspin after its 2008 earnings report suggested a weaker balance sheet than investors had expected .

29-08-2007,101,"Barclays eases debt vehicle fear Barclays is holding collateral that would limit any potential losses arising from its exposure to troubled debt vehicles created by its investment banking arm , people close to the UK bank said yesterday . Investors have expressed concern about Barclays ' exposure to four structured investment vehicles , set up by Barclays Capital , that have run into financial trouble as a result of the turmoil in the credit markets . But people close to the bank said that , even if it was forced to sell all the assets it holds as collateral at current distressed prices , its total loss from the vehicles would be no more than Pounds 75m . The debt vehicles , known as SIV-lites , have become the latest focus of concern by nervous investors as they search for signs of distress after recent market turmoil . Several of the vehicles , which rely heavily on short-term commercial paper for funding , have run into trouble in recent weeks amid a broader crisis of confidence among commercial paper investors . Standard & Poor 's , the credit rating agency , last week slashed its ratings on two SIV-lites created by Barclays Capital and placed two others on review for a possible downgrade . Concern about Barclays ' exposure arose because the bank provided back-up credit facilities to several SIV-lites . To date , two SIV-lites have drawn on their back-up lines with Barclays . Only one is thought to have borrowed a significant sum . But these facilities are supported by the funds ' assets , most understood to be in the form of securities with AAA or AA credit ratings . Barclays ' assessment of its potential loss is based on what people close to the bank describe as a conservative "" mark-to- market "" valuation that assumes the assets had to be sold at current depressed prices . Concern about the SIV-lite structures was fuelled by the resignation last week of Edward Cahill , head of the Barclays Capital team that set up the vehicles . People close to the bank say Mr Cahill and his team had no role in selecting assets for the vehicles , which are managed by hedge funds and other banks . Barclays has also faced scrutiny because in May it set up a SIV- lite vehicle for Sachsen LB , the German public sector bank which was bailed out this month . It is understood Barclays has not provided any back-up financing to the vehicle , called Sachsen Funding 1 . Barclays declined to comment .",barclays eases debt vehicle fear

27-11-2010,109,"Barclays hits reverse on fears over Irish exposure LONDON Barclays was among the fallers on Friday as the sovereign debt crisis sent London markets sliding . Shares in Barclays hit their lowest since July on concerns about its loan exposures to Ireland , Portugal , Spain and Italy , which totalled pound(s)94bn at the end of the third quarter . However , Chris Lucas , Barclays finance director , stuck with guidance that 2010 loan impairments would be lower by 30 per cent on last year . In a presentation at JPMorgan Cazenove , he also suggested that 2011 would be "" slightly better "" than 2010 . "" Asset quality metrics continue to screen slightly better for them , even in regions such as Spain , "" said JPMorgan . Still , Barclays ended 3.2 per cent lower at 259 3/4 p. That matched falls across the financial sector amid fears that the European Union was ready to make lenders to Irish banks take a loss on their investments . Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 5.3 per cent to 38 1/2 p and Lloyds Banking Group was down 4.4 per cent to 61 3/4 p. Insurers were also hit , with Aviva 2.5 per cent weaker at 369 3/4 p and RSA Insurance off 1.8 per cent to 121p . The FTSE 100 ended down 0.5 per cent , or 30.23 points , at 5,668.70. Over the week the index fell 1.7 per cent . Centrica led the utilities lower on Friday , falling 2.6 per cent to 316p , after UK energy regulator Ofgem launched a review of the retail energy market . While findings are not due until March , Centrica 's estimated retail margin of 9-10 per cent did not look sustainable , Deutsche Bank said . Downgrades from Investec and Merrill Lynch sent Kingfisher down 2 per cent to 244 1/2 p ahead of a trading update next week . BT Group was up 4.4 per cent to 172 1/4 p on news it would sell part of its stake in Indian IT services business Tech Mahindra , a deal worth about pound(s)61m at Friday 's prices . The stock was also helped by Merrill Lynch research looking at BT 's programmes to pay down its debt and pension deficit . "" Our base case scenario suggests BT 's share price could go up 36 per cent over the next 2 1/2 years if BT simply delivers on current forecasts , "" Merrill concluded . Capital Shopping Centres gained 5.3 per cent to 401p on speculation that the indicative bid approach from Simon Property Group may shake out other interest , such as from fellow shareholder Westfield . Potential buyers have until December 20 to block Capital 's deal to buy Manchester 's Trafford Centre and give up to a quarter of the company to its current owner Peel Holdings . Pump maker Weir Group rose 2.8 per cent to pound(s)17.56 after a recommendation from Morgan Stanley , which set a pound(s)20 target price . Traders also noted demand from tracker funds ahead of Weir 's addition to MSCI 's indices on Tuesday .

23-03-2007,111,"Barclays house broker attempts to calm nerves over ABN approach LONDON Barclays rose sharply yesterday after Cazenove , its house broker , tried to ease concerns over the approach to ABN Amro , the Dutch bank . The surprise move for ABN has received a lukewarm reception from investors , who are worried that Barclays will overpay . Cazenove told clients yesterday that Barclays ' management would not put forward a deal that diluted earnings post integration . It believes synergies will be greater than the market expects and the transaction will involve substantial disposals , possibly of ABN 's US retail bank , LaSalle . Barclays shares closed3.7 per cent higher at 739p . The Cazenove note was not the only factor behind yesterday 's rise . The shares were supported by rumours that a US bank plans to gatecrash the talks and launch a bid for Barclays . HSBC , the UK 's biggest bank , improved 1.9 per cent to 898p amid talk that an activist investor had been building a stake in it . Dealers said there had been heavy trading in the closing auction several times this week . On Tuesday night a parcel of 14m shares changed hands . But sector watchers thought HSBC shares had also been supported by positive research reports from Citigroup and Goldman Sachs . In its note , Citigroup argued that there could have been an element of "" kitchen sinking "" in HSBC 's 2006 impairment charge . "" We estimate between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn of the Dollars 2.2bn charge against HSBC 's third party subprime portfolio was for loans that are not yetdelinquent , "" analyst Simon Samuels said . In the wider market , leading shares closed higher again . Lifted by strong performances from oil and mining stocks , the FTSE 100 rose 61.2 points , or 1 per cent , at 6,318 , extending gains since a five- month low last Wednesday to 5.3 per cent . The FTSE 250 gained 95.4 points , or 0.8 per cent , to a record high of 11,708.1. Market turnover exceeded 5bn shares , swollen by large dividend- related trades in Vodafone , 0.3 per cent higher at 143.5p , GlaxoSmithKline , 0.1 per cent stronger at Pounds 14.14 , BP , up 2.3 per cent to 528 1/2p , and Kingfisher , 1.6 per centbetter at 280p . These trades take advantage of the way dividends are taxed in France and typically see a UK institution lend stock to a French hedge fund before a dividend payment date . Once the dividend is paid , the stock is returned . There was brisk business in telecoms testing company Spirent Communications , off 1.2 per cent at 62p , as UBS placed a chunk of Lexa BV 's 12 per cent shareholding . Next , the clothing retailer , led the FTSE 100 higher . It gained 6.6 per cent to a record high of Pounds 22.35 after it produced better-than-expected annual results and predicted an improvement in underlying sales this year . Mining stocks were in demand as the copper price touched its highest level since mid-December . Anto-fagasta , the Chilean copper producer , gained 3.9 per cent to 518 1/4p , while Kazakhmys added 1.2 per cent to Pounds 11.49 and Rio Tinto moved up2.1 per cent to Pounds 28.65. Imperial Tobacco drifted 1.5 per cent to Pounds 22.15 on concerns that Spain 's Altadis would hold out for an offer above Euros 50 a share . Imperial 's first bid was Euros 45 a share . Among the mid-caps , Rank Group dropped 7.4 per cent to 208 1/4p as analysts took the red pen to profit forecasts after Wednesday 's late warning that changes to casino gaming duty would hit profits by Pounds 8m . HMV Group dipped 1.9 per cent to 114 3/4p as investors responded an after-hours statement on Wednesday from Brandes that appeared to show that the US value investor had reduced its holding in the retailer to8 per cent from 11 per cent . But sources close to HMV said Brandes had not sold any shares and blamed the confusion on the introduction of new market transparency rules . Rightmove , the online estate agent , rose 6.2 per cent to 513 3/ 4p as traders picked up on the fact that UBS had cleared an overhang of 6.25m shares on Wednesday . Regus added 5.1 per cent to 143 1/4p after Goldman Sachs slapped a 190p target price on the serviced offices group . The shares were supported by rumours that Regus was working on a large acquisition . Travis Perkins , the builders ' merchant , rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 20.59 on the back of a Citigroup upgrade to "" buy "" . The broker said its raised target price of Pounds 22.35 reflected expectations of strong trading in the first half of 2007 and recovery at its Wickes division .",barclays house broker attempts to calm nerves over abn approach london
8-11-2005,113,"Barclays in Pounds 5bn corporate loan sales Barclays is launching one of the largest ever sales of corporate loan risk by a UK bank this week , hot on the heels of a similar deal from HSBC , which is currently being shown to investors . HSBC could price its Pounds 2bn sale of corporate loans from its own balance sheet as early as next week , according to one person close to the deal . But that issue is about to be trumped by Barclays Pounds 5bn deal . The sales take the form of collateralised loan obligations ( CLO ) , but while HSBC 's is a true sale cash CLO of the loans on its balance sheet , Barclays ' deal will be a fully-funded synthetic CLO . The Barclays deal , while being constructed from credit derivatives rather than the actual loans , will still act similarly to the HSBC cash deal because almost the full amount of the deal will be sold in Pounds 4.41bn of AAA-rated super senior tranches . The assets backing the deal come from Barclays Pounds 8bn book of loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and is designed to give the bank regulatory and economic capital relief on its balance sheet . HSBC is set to sell all tranches of its deal down to the sub- investment grade BB-rated tranches and will retain only Pounds 40m of first-loss exposure in an unrated tranche , according to a person close to the deal . The Barclays sale takes the form of a huge super senior tranche with a number of other , smaller tranches . Standard & Poor 's , the rating agency , which issued its ratings on the deal yesterday , said the exact splits between each class of note into sterling , euros and US dollars would be determined when the deal had closed .",barclays in pounds 5bn corporate loan sales
11-02-2005,115,"Barclays in vanguard of consolidation Barclays said consolidation among European banks was "" overdue "" and it expected to be at the "" forefront "" of any activity . Matt Barrett , chairman , said some European institutions look subscale after recent mergers that have created US super-banks . He said : "" Europe is massively overbanked . You see the behemoths emerging in the US so . . . wehave to prepare ourselves for this eventuality . "" We would expect to be at the forefront of it , but our fortunes do not depend on when Europe decides to create pan-European institutions . "" John Varley , chief executive , also stressed that Barclays had no need to do acquisitions in the US or Europe as it was already enjoying strong organic growth . The UK 's third-largest bank yesterday reported a 20 per cent jump in 2004 pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.6bn ( Pounds 3.8bn ) . This was helped by strong performances from Barclays Global Investors and Barclays Capital , the debt-focused investment bank . Bad debt provisions fell from Pounds 1.35bn in 2003 to Pounds 1.09bn. This helped offset a weaker performance from the UK bank where profits fell by 1 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn , partly attributable to weaker mortgage sales and higher costs . Barclays Capital saw profits rise 25 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn ( Pounds 836m ) , helped by a 41 per cent jump in dealing profits to Pounds 1.5bn. Barclays shares fell 5p to 593 1/2p amid some disappointment about higher costs and that the improvement in profits was partly a result of lower bad debt provisions . Mr Varley said that it was clear Barclays must improve its performance in the UK retail bank . "" It is time for UK retail banking to be a source of strong growth again , "" he said . Higher funding costs and international investment at Barclaycard led to more muted growth where profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 801m . Barclays said it was "" watchful but not worried "" about rising consumer debt . Mr Varley also brushed off recent speculation that Barclays could be acquired by a US rival , saying : "" That is the last thing on my mind . "" These are record results . We have the wind in our sails and as we go into 2005 we have terrific momentum . We do not let ourselves be distracted by this . "" Mr Varley said that Barclays was progressing in talks to buy a controlling stake in Absa , the South African bank . Group net interest margins narrowed to 2.59 per cent against 2.61 per cent . The dividend is 24p ( 20.5p ) payable from earnings per share of 51.2p ( 42.3p ) . See Lombard",barclays in vanguard of consolidation
16-05-2008,117,"Barclays keeps options open on capital ratios Barclays said yesterday it was keeping all its options open regarding bolstering its capital ratios . The UK-based bank reported on first-quarter trading without launching a rights issue or announcing other measures to raise fresh equity capital . At the same time , the lender revealed a further Pounds 1.7bn ( Dollars 3.3bn ) of writedowns on the value of debt securities on its balance sheet . The group 's shares closed down yesterday 8 1/2p at 418 3/4p . Chris Lucas , finance director , said : "" We 're not going to rule in or rule out any option at this stage . "" But he hinted that some form of capital-raising would come as the group 's core equity Tier 1 ratio was below Barclays ' 5.25 per cent target , at 5.1 per cent . "" We intend in time to be at least in line with our target , "" he said . He added that the UK banking authorities were looking for banks to operate on higher capital ratios . "" It 's an industry-wide phenomenon and we have to be part of that , "" he said . Barclays had regular conversations with the regulators and "" they are aware of our plans and intentions "" , Mr Lucas said . However , he did rule out paying shareholders dividends in shares rather than cash as a means of raising equity , as some banks have done . "" In our view , they ( scrip dividends ) are not a dividend . "" The group had traded profitably so far this year despite challenging market conditions , Mr Lucas said . Even Barclays Capital , the investment banking business , had turned a profit so far in 2008 . The bank had taken advantage of the absence of some competitors in the mortgage market by mopping up a more than 20 per cent share of new mortgage business being written in the first quarter . However , Mr Lucas said the group had maintained discipline over lending , with an average loan-to-value on new mortgages of 53 per cent , while its existing loan book was on an average loan-to-value of 34 per cent . Rich Ricci , chief operating officer of BarCap and Barclays investment management , said that while markets remained fragile there were signs of stabilisation and even some improvement in liquidity . "" The mortgage market in the US seems to be stabilising , "" he said , but it remained difficult to predict writedowns . In the first quarter the group suffered total write-downs of Pounds 1.709bn , of which Pounds 598m reflected the impairment of underlying assets . Of the total Pounds 495m related to exposures to "" ABS CDO Super Senior "" assets , with the other Pounds 1.214bn from other credit market exposures . The bank benefited from a Pounds 703m gain on revaluation of its own notes in the first quarter , but that was followed by a Pounds 469m loss in April . The group 's leveraged finance loans , such as debt for private equity owned companies including Alliance Boots , were little changed as the group said "" the credit performance of the assets remains satisfactory "" .

Barclays slid 3.8 per cent to 181.9p as the cost of insuring against a Spanish default rose to a record . The stock has been the worst performing UK blue chip over the past five days , losing 12.9 per cent . Barclays has written pound(s)21.8bn of loans in Spain , of which pound(s)10.6bn is not funded by local depositors or the European Central Bank , according to Autonomous Research . Its funding gap across all the main peripheral nations was pound(s)31.8bn , which meant a 50 per cent devaluation would cut Barclays ' tangible book value by a third , the broker said . As well as the eurozone crisis , pressure on the UK lenders reflected the fading prospect of a third round of quantitative easing . "" The end of QE has arrived , with the level of bank lending still in decline and its cost once more rising , "" said UBS . "" Banks with distressed price-to-book multiples and an elevated cost of funding are forced to raise loan prices and seek to shrink loan balances .

The FTSE 's bank index has erased its 2012 gain after dropping nearly 17 per cent since mid-March . Risk aversion dragged the wider market to a new five-month low . The FTSE 100 was down 1.2 per cent , or 66.87 points , to 5,338.38 British Airways and Iberia owner IAG lost 6 per cent to 143.5p on fears about the stability of Bankia , its largest shareholder . The Spanish state-controlled lender inherited its 12.05 per cent stake in IAG last year via a government bailout of Caja Madrid , which held shares in Iberia . Separately , Spain 's Ahorro bank downgraded IAG to "" sell "" on the poor performance of its BMI acquisition and weakening demand out of Madrid . Aviva lost 4.7 per cent to 267.7p on mixed first-quarter figures . Investors were disappointed the insurer would take until the end of the year to find a new chief executive , while some analysts interpreted comments on building balance sheet strength as raising the chances of a dividend cut . Vedanta Resources led the miners lower , losing 4 per cent to 985p . Fees to bankers , provisions and losses on debt meant its annual earnings missed consensus expectations . The rest of the mining sector found little support in spite of rising metals prices . Xstrata lost 3 per cent to 956.2p and Kazakhmys was off 3 per cent to 690.5p. But Antofagasta rose 1.4 per cent to pound(s)10.26 after in-line results . A stabilisation for bullion helped precious metals miners reverse recent underperformance .

TalkTalk bounced 19.8 per cent to 159p after it raised a long-term earnings target and committed to dividend growth of at least 15 per cent annually for the next two years . Headline numbers from the internet provider matched expectations , with customer numbers ahead . Cookson was up 5.5 per cent to 679p after beginning a review to split itself into two . The ceramics and electronics company also gave a seat on the board to Cevain Capital , the activist investor that owns about a fifth of Cookson shares . Kesa Electricals sunk 13.6 per cent to 46.8p on expectations the retailer would cut its dividend next month . A year-end trading update flagged up a higher than expected tax rate , as Kesa could no longer offset losses against profit elsewhere . Analysts saw the tax guidance as cutting earnings by about 15 per cent . Sector peer Dixons Retail , which last week gave a similar warning about offsetting tax , lost a further 4.9 per cent to 14.4p.

28-04-2011,131,"Barclays performs U-turn over Protium BANKS Barclays is buying back a troublesome $9.3bn portfolio of assets , codenamed Protium , just a year and a half after it sold it to a fund dominated by former employees in an elaborate accounting manoeuvre designed to make its profits less volatile . The UK bank detailed the U-turn on Wednesday as it reported a 10 per cent year-on-year increase in underlying profit for the first quarter of 2011 . Its shares responded by falling 4 per cent to 289.65p by the close in London . Analysts said the Protium affair - and the obscurity surrounding it - had damaged Barclays ' reputation , but said the more concerning news was on the outlook for earnings . Whereas Barclays had previously said it was comfortable with analysts ' consensus expectations for pound(s)7bn of annual profit this year , on Wednesday management said that number , while still correct , did not include an estimated pound(s)400m hit from the UK bank levy . "" Effectively that is a 6 per cent downgrade , "" said Simon Maughan , analyst at MF Global . Analysts said the bank 's 8.1 per cent return on equity number for the three months to March had been flattered by the non-inclusion of the levy hit and a pound(s)190m write-up of the value of Protium assets . Analysts questioned the justification for the write-up , given that indices relating to underlying credit market assets fell in the first three months of the year . Barclays is taking back full ownership of the Protium assets from a spun-off entity , called C12 , created in September 2009 to wind down the portfolio with the help of a $12.6bn loan from Barclays . The manoeuvre was designed to protect the bank from losses created by fluctuations in the market value of assets that remained illiquid in the aftermath of the financial crisis , including securities backed by US subprime mortgages . But a tightening of the rules on how much capital banks need to hold has undermined the attractiveness of this arrangement . Under the Basel III regulations agreed last year , banks must hold significantly more capital against loans of this type , negating the capital advantage of the Protium structure . To accelerate the sell-off of the Protium assets , Barclays said on Wednesday that it would pay $83m to C12 . It has also agreed to buy out unidentified third party investors in the fund for $270m . In addition , the duration of the loan to Protium will be shortened and $750m of the proceeds from the loan redemption will be invested into another C12 fund called Helix . Barclays said no gain or loss was expected on the complex transaction . Barclays made a pre-tax profit of pound(s)1.66bn during the January to March period , down 9 per cent on the same period a year earlier . Stripping out the effect of acquisitions , disposals and fluctuations in the value of its own debt , adjusted pre-tax profit was pound(s)2bn , up 10 per cent . But Barclays Capital , the investment banking business and engine of the group 's profitability , disappointed , with underlying pre-tax profit slipping from pound(s)1.57bn to pound(s)1.33bn.

10-05-2005,133,"Barclays plans integration after Absa bank deal Barclays is to integrate its existing African operations into Absa after it agreed yesterday to buy a majority stake in the South African bank for R33bn ( Pounds 2.9bn ) . The UK 's third-largest bank said Absa would purchase Barclays ' other 11 African operations after the deal completes in July . The combined businesses will then be folded into Absa within the next six to 24 months . These include three quoted businesses in Kenya , Botswana and Zimbabwe . The bank said this second phase of the transaction could help increase revenue synergies of R1.4bn that have been promised by Barclays within four years . The Barclays ' acquisition of Absa is South Africa 's largest inward investment since the end of apartheid 11 years ago . It is also Barclays ' biggest acquisition since it bought Woolwich Building Society in 2000 and the first deal under John Varley , new chief executive . Barclays , which was the biggest bank in South Africa before it pulled out 18 years ago due to anti-apartheid protests , is paying R82.50 per share plus a R2 dividend . The price represents a 8.9 times multiple of market consensus earnings for the year ending March 2006 and a 2.4 times multiple to market consensus book value . The UK bank has designed its offer for 60 per cent of Absa in two parts to accommodate minority shareholders eager to benefit from the transaction 's expected upside . The first part is a scheme of arrangement proposed by Barclays to acquire 32 per cent of Absa 's shares . An additional 28 per cent will be sold in a voluntary tender offer by the UK bank . Key shareholders representing 63 per cent of Absa 's share capital have provided written support for the offer . Barclays said the Absa management would stay in place and the Absa board would now work out an incentive pay structure for the management based on delivering the promised synergies . Barclays is forecasting R1.4bn of pre-tax synergies four years after the acquisition 's completion . Of this , 60 per cent would come from enhanced revenues and 40 per cent from cost efficiencies in areas like IT . Job cuts among Absa 's 31,000 staff will be small . Much of the upside would come from revenue synergies by using Barclays ' expertise in credit cards , for example , to help it target new customers in South Africa where just 10 per cent of the population have credit cards . After the transaction , Barclays will generate about one-third of its earnings from outside the UK , from 25 per cent at present . Ten per cent of the total will come from Africa . Absa , which is South Africa 's largest retail bank , has 7m customers , 675 branches and more than 5,000 ATMs . The banks ' operations overlap in only three countries : South Africa , Zimbabwe and Tanzania . However , analysts also expressed considerable scepticism about Barclays ' plans to fold the rest of its African businesses into Absa . The bank has only just begun the process of working out how much the various businesses are worth and how best to arrange the transfer . Some analysts questioned how much value the acquisition would create . Barclays said the move is immediately accretive to earnings per share . The return on investment of the move in Rand terms is about 15 per cent within four years - which works out at low teens in sterling terms . This is higher than Barclays ' group cost of capital , which is about 9.5 per cent . However , some analysts questioned the company 's calculations , arguing that the increased risk inherent in the South African market meant the bank should be attaching a higher hurdle rate for investments made in that country . Barclays shares rose by 3p to 554p and Absa shares rose to R82.5. Barclays is being advised by JPMorgan and Barclays Capital . Absa is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch International .

27-04-2012,135,"Barclays quarterly profits rise to pound(s)2.4bn BANKS ; Surge in investment business lifts results Barclays provided some welcome news for investors ahead of what is set to be a stormy annual meeting today as it revealed a sharp rise in underlying first-quarter profits . A near doubling of income at its investment banking business helped pre-tax profits rise a fifth to pound(s)2.45bn , once a pound(s)300m provision for mis-sold loan insurance and a large negative swing in the value of its own debt were stripped out . Including those factors , the bank fell into a pre-tax loss of pound(s)475m , compared with a pound(s)1.7bn profit in the first three months of 2011 . Analysts highlighted the strong rebound of Barclays ' investment banking , particularly the fixed-income , currencies and commodities business , where income was more than double that of the final quarter of 2011 . The corporate division also recovered strongly - pre-tax profits rose 10-fold - on the back of lower impairment losses in Spain and a one-off credit gain . These two businesses helped lift the bank 's overall return on equity to 12.2 per cent excluding the accounting loss on debt and charge for payment protection insurance . That was a huge improvement on last year , when Barclays ' ROE fell to 6.6 per cent , forcing it to warn it would not reach a 13 per cent target by 2013 . But analysts were wary about the outlook for the rest of the year . "" The Q1 performance reflected usual seasonal strength which will not be repeated , "" Investec told clients . Bob Diamond , the bank 's chief executive , said its performance supported its ambitions of a sustained improvement in returns for shareholders but voiced caution on the UK and Europe 's economic outlook . "" Our progress will not be in a straight line , "" he warned . He faces a potentially acrimonious shareholders ' meeting today after a revolt over his pay package , with a number of large institutions set to vote against the remuneration report . Mr Diamond and Chris Lucas , finance director , have promised to give up half their deferred 2011 bonuses if the bank failed to boost returns and they pledged to increase dividends as its performance improved . The first-quarter dividend remained at 1p per share , which Mr Lucas said was "" appropriate "" given the market uncertainty . He said the extra pound(s)300m PPI provision reflected a spike in claims from borrowers who say they were mis-sold loan insurance in March and April .

25-05-2007,137,"Barclays raises ABN estimates By IAN BICKERTON and PETER THAL LARSEN Barclays has indicated that estimates for cost savings and revenue benefits from its planned takeover of ABN Amro were conservative , as a record quarter from its investment banking division helped it report a strong start to the year . The British bank , which is competing for control of ABN Amro with a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland , had previously indicated that the Euros 63bn ( Pounds 43bn ) takeover would deliver Euros 3.5bn in synergies by 2010 . However , Chris Lucas , Barclays ' new finance director , indicated the bank had been deliberately cautious when calculating the figures . "" We would be working to exceed what we 've announced both in terms of timing and quantum , "" he said . "" We wanted to set them at levels we felt we could exceed . "" Mr Lucas suggested the opportunity for boosting revenues was greater than suggested by the Euros 700m figure Barclays had announced . Barclays is seeking to press ahead with its take-over while investors wait for the RBS-led consortium , which includes Santander of Spain and Fortis , the Belgo-Dutch group , to clarify its rival Euros 71bn bid for ABN Amro . The consortium , which must offer an update on its plans by this weekend , is thought to have met with resistance from the Dutch Central Bank , which must approve a break- up . VEB , the Dutch shareholders ' association , yesterday said it had asked the European Commission to investigate whether the Dutch Central Bank was treating both bidders on "" a fair and equal footing "" . However , Frits Seegers , who will run ABN Amro 's retail and commercial banking operations if Barclays ' bid succeeds , yesterdaydismissed the consortium 's proposed bid as "" just talk "" . Mr Seegers , chief executive of Barclays global retail and commercial banking , told a business conference in Amsterdam : "" It is a ghost bid , not a real bid , just a little bit of talk . "" Reassuring businessmen and city council and government representatives , he also said that Amsterdam would be "" the heart and soul "" of the combined bank 's operations , adding that he had already started house-hunting . Separately , Barclays said pre-tax profits rose 15 per cent in the first quarter , helped by a record performance from its Barclays Capital investment banking division and proceeds from the sale of some properties . Excluding the sale-and-leaseback transactions , pre- tax profits rose 10 per cent . The bank said its UK business had seen some impact from the costs of settling claims from customers seeking repayment of overdraft fees , though these were not material .

22-02-2006,139,"Barclays rules out acquisitions Barclays yesterday ruled out rushing into cross-border acquisitions as the UK 's third-largest bank said it would rely mostly on organic growth to expand outside its home market . John Varley , chief executive , dismissed suggestions that the recent string of acquisitions by European rivals put pressure on Barclays . "" We have growth opportunities , "" he said . "" I see what our competitors do and feel no obligation to emulate them at all . "" Europe 's banking industry has been gripped by take-over fever after the recent acquisition of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro , the Italian lender , by BNP Paribas of France . The deal - which was well received by investors - has prompted speculation that Europe 's other banks will snap up smaller foreign rivals in an attempt to keep up . But Mr Varley stressed the pursuit of size was not an end in itself . "" We have to be ruthlessly realistic with ourselves as to where we can compete , "" he said . Mr Varley has indicated that he wants to increase the proportion of Barclays ' earnings generated outside the UK to at least 50 per cent of the total , from around 40 per cent in 2005 . Yesterday , the bank stressed it could achieve that goal in the next three years through organic growth alone . Both Barclays Capital , its fast-expanding investment banking arm , and Barclays Global Investors , its asset management business , now generate about 70 per cent of their profits outside the UK . International earnings will also grow in 2006 through the inclusion of a full 12 months ' profits from Absa , the South African bank Barclays bought last year . Barclays yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.28bn for 2005 , an increase of 15 per cent over the previous year , as growth at Barcap and BGI compensated for lower profits at its Barclaycard credit card division and sluggish growth at Barclays ' UK retail bank .

14-12-2009,141,"Barclays seeks legal advice banks Barclays has sought legal advice over whether it can mount a challenge to a move this year by Mauser , Dubai International Capital 's German packaging business , to buy back its debt . The bank could set a precedent for challenges to other such balance sheet fixes that have become increasingly common over the past year as borrowers take advantage of unprecedented falls in loan prices to buy back debt . These fixes have angered many lenders as they object to the use of company money to buy back debt at a time when liquidity is sparse or to shareholders drip-feeding cash into portfolio companies to keep them within covenants without having to put up funds to pay down debt or enter into debt restructuring negotiations . Mauser has used EUR25m ( $36.5m ) in funds from its shareholder , DIC , to cure an expected covenant breach in the first quarter of 2009 . This so-called "" equity cure "" , permitted in the loan documentation , allows a company to count equity injections towards the calculation of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , lowering leverage and keeping it within its financial covenants . The company used funds to buy back debt at a discount this year , reducing its leverage . But some lenders objected to the company 's inclusion of the gains from the discount in the price of the debt to face value in its earnings calculations , in addition to the equity injection itself . "" We would rather see more money coming into the business or have a restructuring discussion , "" one lender told Mauser . Motivated by these concerns , Barclays , the agent for the loan financing , sought legal counsel on the matter , who gave the opinion that the gains should not have been included , said one of the lenders . A Mauser official confirmed the move by Barclays but said that the company had a different opinion , that it had been advised it was correct to use the gains in the earnings calculation and it is now seeking a second legal opinion . Moreover , the official said that , regardless of the inclusion of the gain to ebitda , Mauser would not have breached covenants in quarters two to four after the equity injection .

3-02-2009,143,"Barclays shares hit by ratings downgrade BANKS ; Moody 's says more writedowns possible ; Recent rally comes to abrupt halt Barclays ' share price fell and the cost of insuring its debt against default rose yesterday after Moody 's , the rating agency , cut the bank 's credit ratings and raised the prospect of heavy future losses on complex debt securities . The downgrade brought an abrupt end to the remarkable rally in Barclays ' shares , which doubled in value last week after its chairman and chief executive took the unusual step of publishing an open letter to shareholders reassuring them about the bank 's 2008 results . In lowering Barclays ' credit rating by two notches to Aa3 from Aa1 , Moody 's signalled the possibility that continued turmoil in financial markets could lead to "" significant further writedowns on the bank 's credit market exposures "" . Moody 's singled out Barclays ' pound(s)10.3bn ( $14.6bn ) commercial mortgage portfolio and its pound(s)23bn portfolio of securities that are insured by monoline credit insurers . Moody 's also said losses on lending to corporations and consumers in the UK were likely to increase as a result of the deepening economic downturn . Moody 's last month cut Royal Bank of Scotland 's ratings by the same amount . The downgrade is a setback for the bank in its efforts to persuade investors it has weathered the credit market storms better than its rivals . Many investors remain sceptical about the valuation of assets on Barclays ' balance sheet , saying it will eventually have to recognise losses that other banks have absorbed . In the open letter Marcus Agius , Barclays ' chairman , and John Varley , its chief executive , signalled that Barclays had written off pound(s)8bn on complex debt instruments last year but that this was partially offset by hedges and accounting gains from the reduced value of the bank 's own debt . Moody 's also lowered its assessment of Barclays ' financial strength from B to C but acknowledged that , after twice raising capital last year , the bank could absorb pound(s)16bn-pound(s)17bn of losses without breaching regulatory capital limits . "" You could see losses of up to this level and , all other things being equal , it would n't have an impact on this rating , "" said Elisabeth Rudman , a vice-president and senior credit officer in Moody 's financial institutions group . Shares in Barclays fell by more than 10 per cent following the Moody 's downgrade . Meanwhile , the cost of insuring its debt against default rose 14.5 basis points to 187 basis points , meaning it costs pound(s)187,000 a year to insure pound(s)10m of Barclays bonds over five years . Moody 's also downgraded Absa , the biggest retail bank in South Africa , which is 58 per cent owned by Barclays , saying its previous estimate of Absa 's creditworthiness had been based on "" very high probability of systemic and parental support in the event of need "" from Barclays . That probability seems to have shifted in light of Barclays ' own downgrade . Credit : By Peter Thal Larsen in London and Tom Burgis in Johannesburg",barclays shares hit by ratings downgrade

Michael Helsby , analyst , said a good performance from Barclays Capital , its investment banking arm , was priced into the stock , while it was likely that the recent improvement in its retail banking division would run out of steam . "" We are also concerned that Barclays might embark on a meaningful acquisition , "" Mr Helsby said . Ahead of its results today , Bradford & Bingley shares marked time at 450 1/2p . In the wider market , the FTSE 100 closed flat at 5,791.5 , while the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 14.3 points , or 0.2 per cent , to 9,334.6. Volume was average , with 3.1bn shares changing hands .

Smiths Group rose 1.8 per cent to 944 1/2p amid speculation that Honeywell of the US was running the rule over the engineering company .

Goldman Sachs said it expected a slight fall in cigarette sales but said the leading groups had communicated the impact such a ban would have . Imperial Tobacco rose 1.1 per cent to Pounds 17.52.

11-11-2009,147,"Barclays sheds 5 % despite gains Shares in Barclays , the UK 's second largest bank by market capitalisation , fell 5 per cent yesterday in spite of healthy profits for the third quarter , an improved assessment of the outlook for loan losses and the reinstatement of a dividend after almost a year . Analysts said the decline was a reaction to the one-third quarter-on-quarter fall in investment banking revenues to pound(s)3.7bn ( $6.1bn ) , although the Barclays Capital business , which was beefed up significantly over the past year through the acquisition of the US operations of Lehman Brothers , contributed a third of group profits . Huw van Steenis , analyst at Morgan Stanley , said : "" BarCap had a strong start to the year but revenue has now fallen more sharply than at its peers , who were down by an average of just 4 per cent . What everyone is wondering now is what a good investment bank will make in 2010 . "" Regulatory reforms which will require banks to hold greater amounts of capital are set to restrict profits in future , particularly in riskier areas of investment banking . Chris Lucas , Barclays finance director , said yesterday that its 8.9 per cent core tier one capital ratio - the key measure of capital strength - would be closer to 8.2 or 8.3 per cent once the regulatory demands were factored in . Barclays said pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of September were pound(s)1.56bn , compared with pound(s)1.61bn in the second quarter and pound(s)2.8bn a year ago . BarCap generated pound(s)568m of the total . That result was aided by shifting the burden of $12bn of legacy assets in the so-called Protium unit off the balance sheet to former staff . However , it suffered a pound(s)405m loss on its own debt , using the fair value measure . It also became less efficient , with the cost-income ratio rising from 75 per cent in the first half of the year to about 85 per cent , reflecting in large part the aggressive expansion of the equities operation in Europe . The group said it was too early to say how large the bonus payments would be for BarCap staff , dodging one of the most contentious issues facing banks . Barclays is to pay a 1 pence per share dividend , the first since the final dividend of 2008 was passed , from earnings of 7.8p. Mr Lucas said the pay-out ratio would be higher in future but would remain substantially below the 50 per cent ratio that Barclays has traditionally distributed . "" It 's very clear we want to be prudent in terms of the ratio , "" he said . In another sign of improving confidence , management said impairments on the troubled loans that sit on the bank 's books would likely peak in the first quarter of next year , rather than towards the middle of the year as previously expected . For the overall group , the nine-month annualised loan loss rate was 136 basis points compared with 144bp for the first half of the year . But Mr Lucas warned that for the full year , the total figure would be closer to pound(s)9bn than the previously guided range of up to pound(s)9.6bn.

29-03-2007,149,"Barclays should beware of a merger mismatch The lessons of Absa for an ABN deal If the outcome of Barclays ' acquisition of Absa is as "" discouraging "" as South Africa 's central bank governor claims , then it is the kind of profitable setback that John Varley , Barclays ' chief executive , will long for if he takes over ABN Amro - at least judging from his public pronouncements on the deal . Last month , he announced that Absa , in the first full year since the 2005 purchase , was "" performing well ahead of our acquisition business case "" and that total savings from the transaction were "" well ahead of plan "" . Yet in Johannesburg , according to Tito Mboweni , the Afrikaaners and the Brits ca n't even agree whether to start their meetings at 7am or 9am . There may be a political subtext to Mr Mboweni 's comments but if there is a cultural mismatch , Barclays should beware . In a recent survey by Hay Group , a consultancy , and the Sorbonne , European business leaders involved in mergers and acquisitions rued their failure to take human and cultural factors into account when doing deals . A fifth of them said the early months after the merger were a "" culture shock "" and a further 16 per cent said it was more like "" trench warfare "" . Barclays has good reason to be careful about declaring "" mission accomplished "" at Absa . It bears the scars of the Woolwich takeover in 2000 , which it now concedes was not integrated quickly enough . Spookily , in February 2002 , Barclays pointed out that the Woolwich deal had beaten its key integration synergy targets in its first full year in the group . Barclays says it learnt from the Woolwich experience , but suddenly it makes even more sense that Mr Varley is falling over himself to accommodate the political and cultural foibles of his prospective fellow executives at ABN Amro .

25-04-2013,151,"Barclays shows its reliance on investment bank arm Barclays showed its continued dependency on investment banking as a rise in the unit 's profits cushioned a 25 per cent fall in group returns in the first quarter . Profits in the investment banking arm accounted for three quarters of adjusted pre-tax profit of pound(s)1.79bn after rising by 11 per cent in the first three months . Under Antony Jenkins , chief executive , the lender is cutting thousands of jobs and has promised a cultural change at the scandal-hit bank but has resisted political calls to drastically curb the investment bank . Analysts said the results showed how Barclays ' business focus remained mostly unchanged from the era of Bob Diamond , its former chief executive . James Chappell , at Berenberg Bank , said : "" Despite the rhetoric from management , Barclays remains dependent on the investment bank for profits and its good performance . "" Ian Gordon , analyst at Investec Securities , said : "" Ignore the excruciating references to Barclays as the ' go-to ' bank - these are results of which Sir Bob would be proud . "" The shares fell 1 per cent to 294.55p after the statement , which with Credit Suisse began the reporting season for Europe 's banks and preceded Barclays ' annual meeting today . The overhaul initiated by Mr Jenkins cost pound(s)514m in the first three months of 2013 , which damped earnings alongside rising losses at its European retail and business bank where most of the restructuring charges where booked .

The ICB report is due on September 12 . In response , UBS upgraded Barclays to "" buy "" with a 208p target price . Analyst John-Paul Crutchley told clients that , by 2015 , Barclays would be able to have spun off its retail operations if required . "" If full ringfencing is eventually introduced in the UK , the time that Barclays will likely to have before implementation would , we think , allow the group to effectively break itself up into its component businesses with lower exit costs , "" he said . "" Alternatively , if an outcome closer to the status quo is maintained , there is significant potential upside in the stock anyway . "" Barclays closed 5.6 per cent higher at 180 1/4 p. Hopes of longer implementation and more favourable liquidity standards also lifted Lloyds Banking Group , up 6.2 per cent to 35 2/3p , and Royal Bank of Scotland , ahead by 8.2 per cent to 26 1/4 p. US manufacturing and jobs data helped the wider market turn positive after a lower start with the FTSE 100 ending up 0.5 per cent , or 24.12 points , to 5,418.65. A 5.6 per cent advance since last Friday 's close put the index on track for its biggest weekly gain in more than a year .

Among mid-caps , Charter International rose 4.7 per cent to 799p after the welding group opened its books to Melrose , which sweetened an indicative bid to 850p in cash and stock . Charter said it had taken the decision based on increased economic uncertainty - a caution that helped send Melrose 4.4 per cent lower to 300p . "" If we are entering an earnings downgrade cycle , there is little chance Charter avoids a profit warning . We think Melrose are not too concerned about macro uncertainty though , "" said UBS . Profit-taking carried Go-Ahead lower by 5.5 per cent to pound(s)14.96 after annual earnings and guidance from the bus and rail operator matched expectations .

6-08-2005,155,"Barclays THE Few investors think of Barclays as a growth business . But with risk-weighted assets up 20 per cent in the first six months of 2005 and revenues increasing by 14 per cent , this is an increasingly apt description . Most important , the bank is expanding profitably . Return on equity is a fat 23 per cent and this half 's Pounds 2.7bn pre-tax result was well ahead of expectations . Most of the credit goes to the wholesale businesses - Barclays Capital , Barclays Global Investors and UK business banking - which account for 60 per cent of the bottom line . In its low-key way , the group has built some impressive businesses . Barclays and HSBC have both been investing heavily in organic expansion of investment banking . Yet while BarCap increased profits by a fifth in the first half , HSBC 's investment bank saw an 18 per cent decline . Meanwhile , BGI , known as a passive investment manager , now contains the world 's largest institutionally owned hedge fund , with more than Dollars 10bn of assets . While Barclays is pouring money into these divisions , it has shown that it can clamp down on costs elsewhere . UK banking achieved its three-year target of a 6 percentage point reduction in the cost/ income ratio in just six months - though expenses will rise in the second half to help jump-start revenues on the retail side . And Barclays will keep the dividend growing even as it rebuilds its capital ratios following the Absa acquisition .

7-02-2012,157,"Barclays threatens weak start to earnings season as FTSE 100 stalls Barclays was out of favour on concerns that it might kick off bank earnings season on a downbeat note . Ahead of full-year results due on Friday , Barclays drifted 2.5 per cent to 231 1/2 p. A poor performance for Barclays Capital , the cost of the UK bank levy and the likely non-recurrence of a hedging gain seen in the previous quarter meant profit forecasts were too high , Merrill Lynch said . "" While expectations are low , we are concerned they are not low enough , "" said the broker . "" We would be cautious into numbers . "" Barclays ' problems were serious enough to warrant another strategy review , said JPMorgan Cazenove . BarCap would have missed targets consistently since 2010 and , given the changing outlook for UK interest rates and gross domestic product , further action would be needed to match costs to revenue , it said . Cutting costs and risk-weighted assets by about 8 per cent and pound(s)30bn respectively would put BarCap on track to meet targets . The wider market stalled at its highest level since July , with the FTSE 100 ending 0.2 per cent , or 8.87 points , lower at 5,892.20. Cairn Energy was up 5.5 per cent to 345p , accounting for a stock consolidation , after the shares started trading without rights to a 160p-apiece capital return . Morgan Stanley , repeating a 420p target , said Cairn could partner Statoil in Greenland to gain access to cheaper rigs .

Ahead of its results on Thursday , Vodafone took on 1.6 per cent to 177 3/4 p , helped by recommendations from JPMorgan Cazenove and Merrill Lynch . Merrill saw Vodafone 's dividend as secure and played down concerns about price deflation , arguing that pricing remained firm in the US market , which provides about half of Vodafone 's earnings . Randgold Resources was the biggest gainer among the mining stocks , up 2.2 per cent to pound(s)75.65 , after doubling its 2011 dividend and beating forecasts with fourth-quarter earnings . Among the fallers , Glencore International and Xstrata were weak in response to reports that the former would offer a slim premium of 2.8 shares to buy the latter . Glencore retreated 4.5 per cent to 460 3/4 p and Xstrata was down 1.7 per cent to pound(s)12.62.

Petropavlovsk , the Russian gold miner , faded 4.5 per cent to 772p after Renaissance Capital highlighted concerns about the cost of its mine development plan . Polymetal had suffered capital expenditure overruns on a similar project and , if combined with a weak gold price , Petropavlovsk 's net debt could be pushed to 2.5 times operating profit , said RenCap .

14-03-2006,159,"Barclays to sell FirstCaribbean Barclays is in talks to sell its 43.7 per cent stake in FirstCaribbean International Bank for Dollars 1.08bn ( Pounds 624m ) . The bank plans to dispose of its stake in one of the biggest financial institutions in the English-speaking Caribbean to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce , its partner in the joint venture . The Caribbean bank was formed in 2002 through the merger of CIBC 's and Barclays ' Caribbean interests . The bank is quoted on four local bourses including Barbados and Jamaica . The FirstCaribbean bank has assets of about Dollars 9.6bn , approximately 100 branches and employs 3,400 people in 17 countries . Barclays , which last year made a significant acquisition in South Africa , said it was selling because the Caribbean was no longer a strategic area . It is seen as a good time to sell because all the cost savings between Barclays and CIBC have already been taken out . Barclays has owned assets in the Caribbean since 1925 when its international operations were created from the merger of three banks . These were the Anglo Egyptian Bank , Barclays National Bank of South Africa and Colonial Bank . The Caribbean assets came with Colonial Bank . Barclays will book a Pounds 275m net exceptional gain from the sale in its 2006 accounts . The disposal will also improve its tier one capital ratio - a measure of financial strength - by 12 basis points to 7.12 per cent . Shares in Barclays yesterday rose 7 1/2p to close at 668p . The acquisition would give CIBC control of FirstCaribbean with a stake of 87.4 per cent . The remaining 12.6 per cent is publicly held .

Barclays was among the top performers as analysts dismissed worries about an investment bank slowdown . Risk aversion on sovereign debt concerns made for a weak second quarter at Barclays Capital , Morgan Stanley said . It forecast underlying profit at the division to have halved in the second quarter as sales fell 17 per cent from the previous quarter to around pound(s)3.2bn. But Barclays ' valuation remained "" undemanding "" at 0.85 times tangible book value , Morgan Stanley continued . Based on normalised earnings , it set a 400p price target . Meanwhile , Sanford Bernstein argued that Barclays was a good option for investors wanting exposure to a rapid European recovery at reasonable risk . While the sovereign debt crisis was likely to get worse before it got better , the prospect of a eurozone collapse might force Germany to consider a scheme offering mutual support for all members , the broker argued . Such a framework would lead banks including Barclays to move sharply higher . Barclays rose 4.2 per cent to 312 1/2 p. Since closing at 270 1/2 p on July 1 , it has risen more than 15 per cent . The FTSE 100 has trodden a similar path , with the index yesterday rising 2 per cent or 104 points to 5,271.02. It has risen 9.3 per cent in six days , its sharpest rally since April 2009 .

Speculation about disposals helped lift Vodafone by 1.9 per cent to 146p . MF Global analysts said Vodafone was likely to sell its French minority , SFR , to Vivendi for around pound(s)6.5bn before the end of the year . That would strengthen Vodafone 's negotiating position with Verizon , its US partner , which would make a sale of its stake in their joint venture increasingly likely , MF said .

16-12-2009,165,"Barclays under pressure as banks lead Footsie lower london Barclays was under pressure yesterday as banks led the FTSE 100 to its first decline in four days . Shares in Barclays were in focus after RiskMetrics , the corporate governance adviser , raised concerns about its US loan book . It said the American subsidiary "" may lack the earnings wherewithal to avoid an injection of equity capital "" . Third-quarter filings cited by RiskMetrics showed non-performing loans accounting for 16.3 per cent of Barclays ' $20.6bn US portfolio . A fifth of the loan book was in some stage of delinquency , suggesting the percentage of bad debts would rise again in the fourth quarter , it said . "" An increase in non-performing loans , coupled with declines in the fair value of loans held for sale , raises concerns given the unit 's low regulatory capital ratios , "" said Michelle Flaherty , analyst . The US unit 's capital base was "" thin "" and it had reported falling earnings for the past two quarters , so its capacity to handle loan losses was difficult to predict , RiskMetrics warned . Barclays closed 2.4 per cent lower at 284 1/2 p , matching a broad weakness across the banking sector . The FTSE 100 ended lower by 29.57 points , or 0.6 per cent , at 5,285.77. HSBC was the biggest drag on the index , losing 2.5 per cent at 701 3/4 p. British Airways slipped 2.2 per cent to 196 1/2 p in delayed reaction to a cabin crew strike during Christmas and the new year . BA shares had held steady on the day the strike was announced , partly because of the company 's history of reaching last-minute settlements with unions . "" Unfortunately , we feel that the latest BA strike threat is different , "" said UBS . "" We do not think BA will back down . "" UBS estimated that the 12-day strike would cost BA pound(s)275m of sales and about pound(s)40m-pound(s)50m of earnings . For shareholders , this "" seems a fair trade "" given that the cost savings from cutting cabin staff would be pound(s)100m per annum , it said . BG Group led the oil stocks , outperforming for a second day after ExxonMobil 's $31bn acquisition of XTO focused attention on gas producers . Citigroup "" buy "" advice also helped BG , which was up 0.6 per cent to pound(s)10.91. The market was pricing in a lot of risk for BG 's fields in Australia and Brazil , its main sources of growth , said Citi . However , it reckoned a strategy meeting next month would ease those worries . Legal & General found support on a revival of bid rumours , with Resolution once again mooted as the potential predator . L&G closed up 2.6 per cent at 79 1/4 p and Resolution was down 0.4 per cent at 78 1/2 p. Sector consolidation talk also underpinned Smith & Nephew , which rose 0.8 per cent to 630p . One theory doing the rounds was that Zimmer , one of its main US rivals , may be a target for Johnson & Johnson . Tomkins , the subject of speculative bid talk in recent weeks , added 2.5 per cent to 191 1/4 p after house broker Cazenove raised its 2009 earnings forecast by 22 per cent to reflect cost cuts and improved demand . Traders also noted speculative interest in sector peer GKN , up 0.9 per cent to 114 3/4 p. Elsewhere among the mid-caps , Brit Insurance gained 2.6 per cent to 185 3/4 p after UBS upgraded to "" buy "" . Concerns about the insurer 's subprime liabilities looked overdone , said the broker . A third positive tax ruling within a week helped lift Rank Group 2.8 per cent to 80 1/4 p. Rank won the right to claim pound(s)25.9m of value added tax overpaid on slot machines between 2002 and 2005 , and the expected payment bolsters hopes that the group will restart dividends next year . Housebuilders were weak after a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey indicated a slowdown in buyer enquiries . Persimmon fell 2.4 per cent to 416p and Barratt Developments was down 0.6 per cent to 109 1/2 p. Brewin Dolphin slipped 7 per cent to 138 1/2 p after it raised pound(s)14.3m with a surprise share placing to strengthen its regulatory capital base .

17-04-2009,167,"Barclays upbeat as it sets out to woo investors banks Barclays stepped up a charm offensive to persuade investors that it is in robust health , saying it has benefited from a strong start to the year across the financial industry . President Bob Diamond dismissed speculation that strong first-quarter results from Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were a "" one-off "" as the global credit crunch spreads to the wider economy . "" There 's good news for the whole industry there , "" Mr Diamond said in an interview on Bloomberg Television . "" We are reasonably optimistic as we look forward . "" Shares of Barclays rose after the comments , adding to gains in the past week since the bank agreed to sell its iShares exchange-traded fund unit to CVC Capital Partners for $4.4bn. The stock has recovered almost all of the ground it ceded after losing almost three quarters of its value in two weeks in January . Goldman reported first-quarter earnings of $1.8bn on Monday , exceeding estimates and adding to a string of rivals from Citigroup in the US to Deutsche Bank in Europe making bullish statements about trading conditions . JPMorgan Chase said yesterday its investment banking business returned to profitability in the period , also beating expectations . The biggest banks have benefited from strong fixed-income trading volumes , wider bid-ask spreads and the demise or distraction of competitors . While most have radically scaled back on proprietary trading , low-risk trading on behalf of clients has boomed at institutions with the balance sheet to facilitate orders . Even so , some analysts remain sceptical about the sustainability of this year 's earnings , which are flattered by comparison with last year 's aggressive writedowns . "" Investment banks have just had a first quarter that could turn out to be the best quarter of the year , "" said Alex Potter , an analyst at Collins Stewart . Barclays Capital , the securities arm overseen by Mr Diamond , has been building out an international equities and investment banking business since buying the US operations of Lehman Brothers last September . BarCap accounted for about one fifth of pre-tax profit last year . Barclays is determined to shore up its balance sheet and avoid turning to the UK government for capital . Although the Financial Services Authority last month concluded that Barclays had enough capital to endure a severe economic downturn , shareholders have urged the bank to strengthen its buffers . "" Barclays has defied the market to some extent , "" said Robert Law , an analyst at Nomura . "" If it can emerge from calling the market 's bluff then management 's reputation will be enhanced .

10-03-2011,169,"Barclays wins lawsuit brought by San Marino bank over debt products banks ; Total claims of EUR92m dismissed ; Key ruling over sale of CDOs Barclays has won a legal case brought against it by a small San Marino bank which alleged the UK bank sold it complex debt products which were "" much riskier "" than the triple A credit rating they had been given . Cassa di Risparmio della Repubblica di San Marino ( CRSM ) had claimed EUR92m ( $128m ) in losses and lost income , alleging fraudulent misrepresentation over the sale of ultra complex collateralised debt obligations ( CDOs ) during a long-running trial in the UK 's High Court . Barclays had strongly denied the claims . Mr Justice Hamblen ruled on Wednesday that CRSM 's claims all failed on various grounds and must be dismissed , "" despite the considerable skill with which the claimant 's case was constructed and presented "" . Barclays said it welcomed the ruling . "" We have consistently said this case was without merit and any factual basis , "" it said . The case centred around four sets of structured notes with a total nominal value of EUR406m sold by Barclays to CRSM in early 2005 . The notes had embedded within them complex credit derivatives known as CDOs which gave exposure to the credit risk of a pool of assets which included further CDOs . CRSM had alleged that Barclays sold the notes on the basis of an agreed triple A rating which they intended CRSM to rely on as indicating a minimal level of risk when Barclays knew that the notes were far riskier than their credit rating indicated . The ruling is important because it is one of a number of actions faced by banks over complex credit products that have triggered widespread losses in the financial industry . The case has also shone a spotlight into the sale of these derivative products at the height of the markets boom . The judgment will be closely watched by several banks which are considering bringing lawsuits against larger institutions over the sale of complex financial instruments . In another case last year , the High Court ruled in favour of Royal Bank of Scotland which was fighting a claim brought against it by one of Austria 's biggest banks in relation to a complex financial transaction relating to a syndicated loan . A judge ruled that RBS , which is majority owned by the UK government , did not mislead Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich in relation to a complex transaction instigated by RBS for Enron in 2000 . Separately , Italian police and judicial authorities have mounted a widening investigation into banks ' sales of complex derivatives worth a total of EUR40bn to Italian municipalities from 2001 to 2008 . In December , Italian finance police swooped on six banks , including Deutsche Bank and Bank of America , and named 22 people in an investigation into alleged fraudulent sales of EUR1.4bn ( $1.8bn ) worth of derivatives to local authorities in Tuscany .

6-04-2005,173,"Barclays / Absa Group THE When Barclays decided to scale back in South Africa in 1986 , political considerations loomed large . They still do , although in a different way , now that it is close to making an offer for a majority stake in Absa Group , South Africa 's largest retail bank . But at least the business case is sound . A deal with Absa makes sense for several reasons . First , Absa is well-established in a banking market where falling interest rates have fuelled growth but the average household debt ratio remains less than half that of the UK . Second , Barclays ' existing wholesale operation in South Africa complements Absa 's retail focus . Finally , Barclays ' discount to its global peers means it has to pay with cash . With Absa trading on a one-year forward price / earnings multiple of 8.5 compared with Barclays ' 9.9 , it offers growth and strategic fit without dilution . On current estimates , the deal is still accretive if Barclays pays a 10 per cent premium to the current R77 a share - already up 27 per cent since last September 's announcement . Sceptics counter that Absa is cheap for good reasons : namely , political and currency risk . But with Absa representing less than 10 per cent of earnings in a consolidated group , such risk looks manageable . Forecast earnings growth for Absa of 12 per cent a year to 2008 - before any synergies - should cushion rand movements . Much now rests on the government 's as-yet-undisclosed conditions . Barclays is right to take its time mulling them over , but the logic is there .",barclaysabsa group the
27-04-2012,175,"Barclays / Deutsche Are the investment banking arms of Barclays and Deutsche Bank digging in to make a stand against their US rivals ? Last year Wall Street banks took market share from their European counterparts . But first-quarter results from Barclays Capital and Deutsche 's investment bank yesterday , both stronger than Credit Suisse 's comparable figures the day before , show they are faring better than their regional peers - or , at least , not as badly , for now . But one may be losing ground to the other . Consider BarCap 's performance in fixed income , currencies and commodities , where revenue rose 9 per cent to pound(s)2.4bn from a year ago . That suggests BarCap is maintaining , even increasing , its share . Or take the unit 's equities revenue , up just 1 per cent . Yet that makes BarCap and Morgan Stanley the only investment banks to report an increase so far . Overall , revenue at the UK lender 's wholesale bank climbed 3 per cent , compared with Deutsche 's 11 per cent decline , itself in line with JPMorgan Chase 's comparable revenue drop . Deutsche 's FICC machine , meanwhile , generated income of EUR3.4bn , 8 per cent lower than a year ago but still trumping its UK rival by EUR500m . That may be less than the one-fifth FICC decline at Credit Suisse , but US peers ' equivalent revenues rose 5 per cent . It was a different story in equities , however : the German investment bank 's revenue slid 23 per cent , although at EUR726m it was still higher than Barclays ' number . But , as the European rivals tough it out , they face two obstacles closer to home . For a start , the second quarter has started more slowly than the first , and could be flat . And , from next January , they will have to contend with new EU rules ( Capital Requirements Directive 4 ) that will benefit less-constrained US banks .

12-09-2013,177,"Barclays / Lehman At Barclays , the adaynniversary of the death of Lehman Brothers is an occasion for a toast , not revisiting old regrets . For most of us , Lehman 's demise marks the moment when a banking brush fire exploded into an out-of-control economic inferno . But with the fire came a fire sale , and Barclays was flush enough , and clever enough , to pull out its cheque book . With its recent difficulties ( Libor scandal , restructuring ) , it is easy to forget how five years ago , Barclays took the left over pieces of Lehman and turned itself into an investment banking powerhouse . Barclays spent just $250m for the Lehman investment banking and capital markets businesses ( it spent another $1.5bn for the corporate headquarters and two data centres , all of which have surely appreciated too ) . In 2007 , the Lehman debt and equity underwriting and merger advice business alone generated $4bn in revenue , ranking it ninth globally , according to Dealogic . Lehman lacked the prestige and dominance of Goldman Sachs , but recall that Barclays was an afterthought in these businesses , particularly in the US . 2008 was a good year to snap up flailing banks , but Bear Stearns was a minnow and Bank of America was hot for Merrill Lynch ( BofA chief executive Ken Lewis , regrettably , bought all of Merrill 's assets and assumed all its liabilities rather than waiting for it to go belly up and picking up the choicest bits ) . In 2012 , Barclays was eighth in investment banking revenue worldwide , one spot higher than where Lehman stood in 2007 . The pound(s)4bn profit ascribed to the investment bank makes it Barclays ' largest segment , pound(s)1bn ahead of the retail and business banking . Since 2010 , Barclays shares are up 11 per cent . That trails JPMorgan 's 30 per cent but is ahead of BofA , HSBC , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley . Happy anniversary , indeed .",barclayslehman

Ciba , which had sales of SFr6.52bn and 13,000 employees last year , is one of the most famous names in Swiss industry and a cornerstone of its home town Basel . But while prized for its expertise and patents , the company has been on a downward spiral for some years . Problems came to a head last month when Ciba reported a second-quarter loss of SFr606m after a SFr595m impairment charge on its water and paper treatment division . Adding Ciba , which specialises in plastics additives , coatings and water and paper treatment , will make BASF a world leader in plastics additives and in chemicals for paper , and number two in coating effects , from fourth in all three categories . BASF will offer SFr50 a share , a 32 per cent premium on Friday 's close and 64 per cent more than the weighted average of Ciba 's share price over the past 30 trading days . Although well below the share price set when Ciba was spun off from Novartis in 1997 , analysts expected no counter-bids . Ciba shares jumped by more than 28 per cent to close at SFr48.68. The offer values Ciba , including debt , at SFr6.1bn. Ciba 's results were followed by a campaign by activist shareholders to unseat Armin Meyer , the chairman and , until last January , chief executive . "" Against the backdrop of increasingly challenging conditions in our industry , this is a transaction that combines a fair price with an industrially compelling solution for Ciba , "" said Mr Meyer . "" With the acquisition of Ciba we are strengthening our portfolio and expanding our leading position in speciality chemicals , "" said Jurgen Hambrecht , BASF 's chief executive . The deal would boost earnings per share from the second year . The deal is dependent on an extraordinary meeting to lift Ciba 's voting right restrictions , and on acceptances from two thirds of shareholders .

The German company , whose stock has fallen by 11 per cent over the past year , said it was also considering reviving a share buy-back programme . Kurt Bock , who took over as chief executive in May , acknowledged that the timing of its long-term strategy presentation - amid financial turmoil , fears of a break-up of the eurozone and another recession - was far from ideal . The company cautioned in October that demand growth had continued to slow as cautious clients delayed orders and reduced inventories . Still , BASF 's chief executive argued that Europe would "" get its act together at the end of the day "" and said the company was not planning for the euro 's demise . BASF now expects to achieve EUR115bn ( $153bn ) in sales by 2020 , compared with a previous forecast of EUR90bn and last year 's level of EUR63.9bn. Emerging markets are set to account for 45 per cent of sales in 2020 compared with 34 per cent last year . The chemical maker also wants to achieve earnings before interest , taxation , depreciation and amortisation of EUR23bn by 2020 , compared with EUR11.1bn last year , equating to a compound annual growth rate of 7.5 per cent . The company will invest up to EUR35bn between now and 2020 to increase organic growth and more than a third of this investment will be in emerging markets . BASF has profited recently from its Verbund system - an integrated production system that harnesses the by-products of chemical production to create new materials , delivering big savings in raw materials and energy costs . Under Jurgen Hambrecht , BASF 's previous chief executive , the company sought to move away from commoditised , cyclical businesses to focus more on specialised , close-to-customer products . The company also made several large acquisitions including Ciba , a speciality chemical maker and Cognis , a maker of cosmetics and personal care products . Mr Bock said BASF will continue to move its portfolio downstream by focusing on materials designed to fulfil specific functions , for example , in lithium ion batteries for electric vehicles . BASF said it is targeting EUR500m in sales from products for electromobility batteries by 2020 .

Engelhard 's board said it was reviewing the Dollars 5.1bn offer , a Dollars 260m premium on a first bid of Dollars 37 a share made by the German company in early January . Barry Perry , Engelhard chief executive , has rejected BASF 's offers , arguing that they are too low . He wants shareholders to accept a plan to buy back20 per cent of stock at Dollars 45 a share at the annual meeting on June 2 . Should the Engelhard board remain firm , the meeting at the end of next week will provide a showdown finale to one of the toughest transatlantic takeover battles . Both sides want shareholders to decide who wins that day . Mr Hambrecht and Mr Perry are lobbying stakeholders to install a majority of their nominees on an enlarged Engelhard board , opening the way for either an agreed takeover offer or a limited share buyback programme . The BASF chief executive has repeatedly said he could walk away from the Engelhard deal and buy other companies . In his view , the Germans made a fair , fully priced initial offer and will not be tempted to overpay . At the same time , he has stressed the strategic importance of Engelhard to BASF , as this fast-growing business would lessen the giant 's dependence on the price cycle in the chemicals business . But Mr Hambrecht was happy to put his own reputation on the line yesterday by warning Engelhard shareholders that he would "" let the offer expire and pursue other opportunities "" if they did not back BASF on Friday next week . Engelhard , meanwhile , gave an indication of the expense of its protracted defence . The company said second-quarter earnings would have beaten analysts ' expectations of56 cents or 57 cents a share if it had not been for BASF 's bid .

The move could reduce the short-term chances of the group making an acquisition or paying a special dividend but BASF said its options remained open . It was warmly received by analysts and rating agencies , who said it would improve comparisons of BASF 's balance sheet with competitors and reduce volatility . Pension liabilities have been in focus at German companies since Thyssen-Krupp saw its credit rating downgraded to junk by Standard & Poor 's two years ago as their debt-like nature meant the conglomerate was more stretched financially than thought . Most German groups accounted for their liabilities on the balance sheet , often leading to fluctuations as their value varied widely . But in recent years many blue-chips have moved some or all their liabilities into so-called contractual trust agreements ( CTAs ) , which treat them as debt off the balance sheet . BASF said yesterday it would move Euros 3.7bn into a CTA to finance Euros 2.9bn in BASF AG 's liabilities . The group as a whole has pension liabilities of Euros 3.9bn. The move will be financed from its cash pile , which amounted to Euros 3bn at the end of the first half , and cashflow , with analysts from HVB expecting Euros 2.5bn this year plus an extra Euros 1bn from the sale of Basell .

The world 's largest chemicals group by revenues said it had reached an agreement with Cognis 's owners - US investment bank Goldman Sachs and British private equity group Permira - to buy the company for an equity purchasing price of EUR700m . Including Cognis 's high debt load and the speciality chemicals maker 's pension obligations , the deal values the company at EUR3.1bn. The move , which is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be formally completed by November , marks a fast return to acquisitions for BASF after its almost EUR4bn takeover of Swiss rival Ciba in 2008 . The deal will give the German chemical maker a boost in its drive to diversify away from oil-based products into environmentally friendly , less cyclical and higher-margin products with natural ingredients such as coconut oil . Cognis mainly produces cosmetics and personal care products such as antiageing creams and detergents . The deal will also bring BASF closer to large global consumer product groups such as Procter & Gamble , to whom Cognis is a preferred supplier . "" Cognis is much closer to the customer and [ more ] market-driven than BASF , "" Jurgen Hambrecht , BASF 's chief executive , said . "" We are diversifying BASF 's industrial exposure by going into consumerfocused businesses . This is almost an ideal acquisition for BASF , "" he added . Analysts welcomed the acquisition . "" Strategically it is a sound move in our view , pushing BASF towards a leading position in personal and homecare products , "" said Stephan Kippe at Commerzbank . The deal could mark Mr Hambrecht 's last significant strategic step , as he is set to be replaced by chief financial officer Kurt Bock next year . Mr Hambrecht ruled out further large acquisitions for at least two years as he said BASF 's priority was to keep its solid A plus credit rating . The deal will be financed with cash and the issuance of commercial paper . BASF plans to integrate the business into its performance products segment , which made revenues of EUR9.4bn in the past year . "" By purchasing Cognis , we will in particular expand our portfolio with products based on renewable raw materials , "" said John Feldmann , head of BASF 's performance products . He said integration costs would be EUR200m-EUR250m , while the future synergies would amount to a minimum of 5 per cent of Cognis ' sales .

2-05-2006,195,"BASF stays firm on bid for catalyst group CHEMICALS BASF , the world 's largest chemicals group , yesterday set the scene for a showdown over its proposed acquisition of US catalytic converter specialist Engelhard . A the long-running bid battle now looks set to be decided at Engelhard 's annual meeting on June 2 . The German chemicals group refused to raise its Dollars 38 a share bid but extended its Dollars 4.9bn all-cash offer until June 5 and proposed a total of five nominees to join the Engelhard board at the AGM three days earlier . Jurgen Hambrecht , chief executive , said : "" Clearly we believe that this will lead them to facilitate the BASF offer and terminate Engelhard 's proposed leveraged recapitalisation and 20 per cent share buy-back . "" Last week , Engelhard scotched hopes of a negotiated deal with BASF , after three months of ding-dong talks , unveiling instead a defence strategy centred on a planned Dollars 1.2bn share buy-back at Dollars 45 a share . Engelhard also said it would extend its board from six to nine , proposing its own nominees . However , if BASF 's nominees are all elected , they would gain the majority on the board . BASF 's three new nominees are Arthur de Graffenried , a former Citigroup banker ; William Vinson , a lawyer with LockheedMartin ; and Stanford Warshawsky , an investment banker , former chemicals company director and member of the German-American chamber of commerce . BASF had already proposed Julian Brodsky , chairman of Comcast , and John Linehan , a director of Pacific Energy Partners . Some Engelhard shareholders signalled last week that they expected BASF 's offer - increased from Dollars 37 to Dollars 38 a share after the group conducted due diligence - to be raised to at least Dollars 40 . By the previous bid deadline of April 28 , less than1 per cent of Engelhard stock had been tendered by its shareholders . But advisers have stressed that the German company is convinced its offer is already fair and point to Engelhard 's share price , which is only a touch above Dollars 38 . Mr Hambrecht said yesterday : "" If Engelhard 's shareholders do n't vote in favour of our nominees , we will allow our tender offer to expire on June 5 and turn our attention to other opportunities . "" Last week , BASF announced a potentially lucrative asset swap deal with Russia 's Gazprom . BASF has been drawn to Engelhard by its catalyst business , which is growing fast thanks to tightening emissions standards around the world . Last week , Engelhard reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 69m , up19 per cent , on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn , up 43 per cent . A Reuters poll of analysts yesterday forecast that BASF , which reports first-quarter results on Thursday , would see a 10 per cent increase in revenue .",basf stays firm on bid for catalyst group chemicals
27-02-2009,197,"BASF swings to loss andfears ' even greater decline ' chemicals BASF , the world 's largest chemicals company , has been hit by its first quarterly loss in seven years as the economic slump hit demand - a downward trend the German group said was showing no sign of abating . Jurgen Hambrecht , chief executive , said chemical consumption had not picked up at the start of the year and that he expected 2009 sales to fall - for the first time since 2002 - and operating income to record "" an even greater decline "" . The banking crisis caused economic turmoil in late 2008 , leading BASF to report a fourth-quarter sales decline of 2.7 per cent to EUR14.3bn ( $18.3bn ) and a net loss of EUR313m , from net profit of EUR793m the year before . It is the company 's first loss since late 2001 . For the full year 2008 , sales rose 7.5 per cent to EUR62.3bn , a result of higher oil prices , while earnings before interest and taxes slipped 11.7 per cent to EUR6.5bn and net profit tumbled 28.4 per cent to EUR2.9bn. Mr Hambrecht painted a dark picture of conditions on the front line of the real economy . Demand for chemicals had slumped by as much as 50 per cent in areas such as car making as consumers all over the world tightened their belts . BASF expected the big industrialised economies to shrink by 1.6 per cent over the year , Mr Hambrecht said , a number that suggested that prospects in the second half of the year might be better than the acute declines being seen at the moment . But he said forecasts were so tricky it was impossible to say if the world could shake off recession this year . "" And even if things were to improve to hit zero growth by the end of the year , the battle would not have been won , "" he added . He said demand could soon pick up when manufacturers had used up material they had in stock - only to sag again once inventories were replenished . Such starts and slumps could add to economic uncertainty , he warned . The Ludwigshafen-based company has already taken action . In November it asked one-quarter of its 95,000 workers to take holidays and days owed and in January put about 3,000 workers on part-time hours . It is also in the process of cutting its workforce by 1,500 and Mr Hambrecht said BASF would not shy away from closing plants in Europe , the US or Asia if output fell to uneconomic levels . He added that he was constantly in touch with employees ' representatives about possible next steps . Credit : By Gerrit Wiesmann in Ludwigshafen",basf swings to loss andfears 'even greater decline'
12-11-2004,199,"BASF THE Chemical companies are in a cyclical sweet spot at the moment , and none more so than BASF , the largest and most efficient of the commodity producers . The strongest global economic upturn for years has boosted volumes and utilisation rates , while a lack of new capacity has allowed the sector to regain genuine pricing power . The German group 's third-quarter results show just how powerful a combination this can be . Volumes jumped 14 per cent , with growth across all units and regions . Prices , up 10 per cent at group level and by 22 per cent at the plastics arm , increased ahead of raw material costs - helped by the fact that BASF 's oil division , which provides half the group 's crude feedstock , serves as a natural hedge against rising oil prices . It is no wonder quarterly operating profits more than doubled to Euros 1bn on a one-fifth gain in revenues , beating all forecasts . No cycle lasts for ever , but analysts expect almost two more good years until chemical demand peaks in mid-2006 and even BASF will admit to one . Meanwhile , it expects to exceed its cost of capital ( which it puts at a very high 10 per cent ) this year , which should prompt a dividend increase and even more share buybacks . The stock has nicely outperformed over the past year , but , at around five times next year 's earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation still suffers from a lower rating than rivals such as Dow Chemical and DuPont .

Yesterday 's first-quarter numbers , showing operating profits up 40 per cent and product prices up 13 per cent , give the lie to that conservatism . But BASF remains anxious to keep expectations well under control . There is a reason for the Teutonic phlegm . Management wants investors to believe BASF is not just a cyclical play , although its valuation - at an 8 per cent discount to the sector - suggests the market remains unconvinced . The upturn in the chemicals cycle is lasting longer than usual but it can not carry on forever . And BASF believes the European and North American market will grow more slowly than gross domestic product until 2015 . To counter this , it is pursuing cost-cutting measures as well as investment in markets such as China . But if management wants to persuade the market that BASF is more than just a cyclical punt , it must put its money where its mouth is . So far , free cash flow has been used to finance share buybacks and dividend increases . But with its cash pile forecast to reach - on conservative estimates - over Euros 1bn by the end of the year , BASF must start making effective downstream acquisitions as well as returning cash to investors .",basf the

28-04-2006,211,"BASF / Engelhard After four fruitless months seeking a white knight to counter BASF 's takeover bid , Engelhard 's management has fallen back on that old favourite : a leveraged recapitalisation . The Dollars 45 per share being offered for 20 per cent of the outstanding equity is a red herring . Engelhard 's stock does not deserve a rating at parity to rival catalyst provider Johnson Matthey's . This is a straight buyback - any "" premium "" to BASF 's Dollars 38 offer will wash through into a lower value for the remainder of Engelhard 's outstanding equity . Standard & Poor 's has said the recap will probably cut Engelhard 's long-term credit rating to just above junk .

Engelhard 's valuation case , based on earnings accretion , is also sensitive to the yield on the new debt as well as requiring Dollars 15m of promised annual cost savings . The management 's decision to put the opposing offers to a shareholder vote is laudable . Engelhard 's better-than-expected first- quarter results might even help its case .

13-11-2007,213,"BHP 's buy-back to restore character BHP Billiton 's plan to conduct a Dollars 30bn ( Pounds 14.4bn ) share buy-back if its Rio Tinto takeover is successful is designed to preserve the company 's Australian character and take advantage of tax credits . Rio Tinto 's shareholder base is skewed to the UK as 72 per cent of its shareholders own UK-listed plc shares , with 28 per cent owning Australia-listed Limited shares . BHP 's shareholder base has a more Australian bias , with 60 per cent made up of limited shares and 40 per cent made up of PLC shares . A takeover of Rio by BHP would lift the proportion of PLC shares compared with Australian limited shares . As 49 per cent of the combined assets by value would be in Australia , he said the company 's aim was to have roughly half of the group 's equity in Australian-listed limited shares . This would let holders of the limited shares avoid paying tax on their dividends because of the Australian system of "" franking credits "" , said BHP . Although the Dollars 30bn buy-back would apply "" across the board "" , BHP said the group would target UK-listed PLC shares to be bought and cancelled , reducing the size of the UK shareholder base . Analysts have said it would also help BHP 's relations with the Australian government if the company was 50 per cent-owned by Australian investors . BHP , which had very low gearing , plans to finance the Dollars 30bn buy-back with debt , which it said would make more efficient use of its balance sheet .

The man who runs BHP Billiton lives up to his moniker : he has just unveiled the biggest half-year profit ever for an Australian company - BHP is listed in London and Sydney - and the mining sector 's largest share buy-back programme . The buy-back sends a message of confidence - Dollars 10bn is equivalent to9 per cent of BHP 's market capitalisation . On current forecasts , BHP can certainly afford it . Societe Generale estimates BHP will generate operating cash flow of almost Dollars 40bn for the three years to June 2009 . Take off Dollars 24bn for capital expenditure and regular dividends and the Dollars 16bn left is enough to fund the Dollars 10bn buy-back and pay off most of the group 's current net debt . Mr Goodyear , who is leaving at the end of the year , will go out on a high . BHP 's solid finances and diversity of activities engender stability . Meanwhile , new oil projects and uranium should provide growth . BHP has enjoyed a windfall in recent years as commodity prices have exploded . Fear that this can not last , however , is the reason BHP 's shares have been steadily derated since 2004 : those listed in London now trade at less than nine times June 2007 earnings . Last year , BHP 's shares went nowhere while rivals Xstrata and Anglo American performed rather better on the back of merger activity and restructuring . In that context , big cash payouts are one way of restoring some momentum , especially with the likes of copper and oil having cooled off recently . Virtually all of the 37 per cent year-on-year increase in BHP 's earnings before interest and tax for the six months to December came from price increases .

18-08-2010,217,"BHP 's potash bid puts M&A back on mining agenda News analysis ; Group 's $39bn move heralds merger battle as offer is rejected by Canadian producer , writes William MacNamara BHP Billiton 's enchantment with potash , an obscure but vital commodity , has yielded the biggest takeover bid in the mining sector since BHP abandoned its hostile bid for Rio Tinto in 2008 . In what appears to be the opening shot in a new mining merger battle , BHP tabled a preliminary offer of $130 per share for Canada 's PotashCorp , the world 's biggest potash producer . That values the equity of Potash Corp , whose board immediately rejected the offer , at $39bn . "" Following Monday 's Vedanta-Cairn deal , M&A is now clearly back on the agenda for miners with robust balance sheets , "" said mining analysts at Liberum Capital , referring to Indian miner Vedanta 's plans to buy a majority stake in an oil producer for up to $9.6bn. The offer marks BHP 's return to large-scale M&A activity after a hiatus of nearly two years . Its reluctance to make opportunistic acquisitions in 2009 was notable because the company held over $10bn in cash . Its cash pile now stands at $8.4bn. Last year as rivals struggled with debt , BHP was criticised for having too much unused cash . The Melbourne-based miner defended itself by repeating that it was only interested in "" long-life , low-cost , tier one assets "" . PotashCorp now appears to fulfil those requirements . Potash is a raw ingredient of agricultural fertilisers in the same way that iron ore - a core BHP commodity - is the raw material for steel . By acquiring the world 's biggest potash producer , BHP would be taking a bet that farmers will need more fertilisers to meet rising food demand as incomes rise across the developing world . According to PotashCorp , consumption of meat in China has risen sevenfold in the past 30 years and fruit and vegetable consumption tenfold , despite a limited base of arable land . Over the past two years BHP has repeatedly made its case for entering the mining side of the fertiliser business , saying that potash was the sector in which it was most interested . Rumours of a possible PotashCorp bid have persisted . Few analysts were surprised at the offer . But some were concerned that the bid ran against the "" go it alone "" strategy in fertilisers that BHP has espoused over the past year . In January BHP agreed to buy Athabasca Potash for C$341m . Athabasca owned early-stage potash assets in Saskatchewan near Jansen , BHP 's flagship potash development . BHP said that it would develop these assets jointly to establish a leading position in fertilisers without needing to buy a major producer . "" This is quite a backflip , "" said one analyst who asked not to be named . "" The finance director was crystal clear that they had a better greenfield option in Athabasca and Jansen and that they did not want to do a big acquisition . "" PotashCorp 's immediate rejection sets the stage for a potentially lengthy battle . "" PotashCorp believes that BHP Billiton intentionally launched its proposal just as the fertiliser industry emerges from an unprecedented demand decline associated with the global slowdown in order to seize the value that PotashCorp is posed to create for its shareholders , "" the company said yesterday . According to analysts at Evolution , the bid values PotashCorp at just over 24 times forecast earnings for 2010 , against a peak of 55 times that the shares reached in 2008 . Potash shares jumped by more than a quarter from $112 to $142 yesterday , suggesting that BHP may need to return with a higher price to win over investors . The rebound in fertiliser demand is now pronounced . PotashCorp , which has net debt of about $3.4bn , saw pre-tax profits in the first half of the year rise from $452m to $1.28bn. "" We estimate BHP could pay up to $60bn in cash before a deal would become earnings neutral , "" said Liberum analysts . "" But we can not see BHP being forced to pay such a premium given the negligible interloper risk . "" Any interlopers or rival bidders may find Potash Corp less palatable after the board passed a poison pill "" shareholder rights plan "" , which is designed to prevent anyone from buying any more than 20 per cent of the company .

This would cut annual earnings for Rio and BHP by as much as 30 per cent and 19 per cent , respectively , Merrill Lynch forecast .

8-02-2010,223,"BHP and Rio offer iron-clad earnings BHP Billiton ' s interim results on Wednesday and Rio Tinto ' s full-year results on Thursday will be highlights during a week of announcements by leading mining companies , writes William MacNamara . Investors in Anglo-Australian BHP and Rio can count on earnings uplifts from the strong resurgence in industrial metal prices that gained pace throughout the six months to December . The market is buzzing with expectation that the benchmark price of iron ore , both companies ' most profitable product in 2009 , will in the next contract year reverse most of the discount agreed in the current contract year . But investors will judge the companies differently . Unlike recently traumatised Rio , BHP faces the happy dilemma of abundant cash . This has led investors to focus on the possibility of a large dividend , a share buy-back programme , rising capital expenditure , a large acquisition - or a combination of these . Rio is likely to frame its results as a milestone in recovery after a terrible year , and investor expectations will come from a low base . Figures from its Alcan aluminium division , which recorded a net loss in the first half and is being restructured , will be closely scrutinised . Group debt could grab the most attention . After a rights issue and asset sales in the second half , Rio is expected to halve net debt to about $19bn . With cash flow also rising Rio could then make good on its interim pledge , expecting "" to make a 2009 final dividend payment subject to satisfactory trading results "" .",bhp and rio offer iron-clad earnings
23-08-2012,225,"BHP Billiton When BHP Billiton pauses to rethink expansion of its $20bn Olympic Dam copper and uranium project in South Australia , it is a sign that this commodities cycle is fizzling out . The diversified miner is no more immune than its peers to falling commodities demand and prices , or rising costs . At least it has the discipline to know when to halt capital expenditure : half way into early engineering work on the project , the capital costs were rising too fast . Factor in local cost inflation and poor productivity and it should be no surprise that BHP has more attractive spending options . A $342m after-tax impairment on Olympic Dam and other projects , also announced yesterday , is on top of $1.8bn on its US shale gas assets and $355m on nickel assets in Australia . These exceptionals shrank BHP 's June full-year net profit more than a third from 2011 to $15.4bn - the same level as five years ago in nominal terms , despite revenue up a fifth since 2008 to a record $72bn . If The Big Australian 's results represent a new normal for the mining industry , what should chief executive Marius Kloppers be doing to adapt ? For a start , he must cut costs hard to protect margins . He can not control price , but knows that it will be partly driven by the pace of supply response . That suggests allocating capex only to projects for commodities likely to be in demand in the next decade , for which supply lags behind demand . Mr Kloppers should also watch gearing , which crept up to 26 per cent with its Petrohawk Energy acquisition . BHP has more options than most . Yet , trading on 9.5 times forward earnings - a discount to Anglo American and Xstrata - it has no credit for its diverse portfolio or for its outperformance of its index since the crisis . Investors who sense a commodities slide beyond China 's managed slowdown have a point . Mr Kloppers must show his mettle now : impairments hurt ; rising profits heal .",bhp billiton
24-08-2006,227,"BHP Billiton As problems go , struggling to spend your cash is one of the better ones . BHP Billiton yesterday unveiled a58 per cent rise in full-year operating profit and a 25 per cent increase in operating cash flow before capital expenditure to Dollars 12bn . How is the miner allocating this largesse ? BHP expects continued healthy demand and constrained growth in industry supply . Next year 's planned 10 per cent increase in capex to Dollars 7.5bn therefore makes sense . Even so , at less than 40 per cent of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , capex is low by industry standards . There are simply not enough skilled people available to manage significantly more investment . Another option is to return cash . BHP increased its final dividend by28 per cent . The pay-out ratio , however , continues to fall , although it is not out of step with its peers . BHP also unveiled a Dollars 3bn share buy-back and could afford more . For most companies , a dividend cut is anathema and , in a cyclical industry , it is understandable that BHP prefers buy-backs . Chip Goodyear , chief executive , also believes that mining sector shares are undervalued . At 9 times 2007 earnings , based on metals prices some way below current spot levels , BHP 's valuation is not stretched . Its share price , however , would not be immune if the future turned out to be less rosy than in the miner 's optimistic macro view . If sector shares are cheap , another option is acquisitions and BHP has proved aggressive . Last year it was criticised for paying up for WMC Resources , but the near vertical surge in uranium prices has vindicated its judgment . For investors , deciding how long commodity prices will remain strong is very difficult . With more sector deals likely , the easier choice may be to back potential targets , rather than acquirers such as BHP .",bhp billiton
19-01-2010,229,"BHP Billiton and Anglo American lead Footsie higher LONDON BHP Billiton and Anglo American were among the biggest gainers yesterday as mining stocks lifted the London market . BHP took on 1.5 per cent to pound(s)20.74 1/2 amid hopes it would restart its share buyback programme at interim results next month . The group suspended its buyback in late 2007 , when it still had $4.2bn remaining to return to shareholders , to pursue its failed bid for Rio Tinto . UBS said BHP was in a strong position to restart the programme , forecasting the group would generate $7bn of surplus cash over the next 18 months . Releasing the $4.2bn currently set aside would only boost earnings per share by about 1 per cent , analyst Olivia Ker said . However , UBS also noted that BHP 's Australian listing has been trading at a premium of 21 per cent to the UK shares . Management would likely target any buyback funds towards London to narrow this gap , it said . Sector peer Anglo American gained 3.2 per cent to pound(s)28.09 on the back of "" buy "" advice from Merrill Lynch . "" We believe that if management are not seen to be delivering both operationally and strategically by mid-late 2010 , Xstrata could be back to bid again , "" Merrill told clients . The broker also raised its Anglo target price to pound(s)37.50 to reflect a rebound in platinum prices . A weaker dollar buoyed the rest of the miners , which helped lift the FTSE 100 by 39.02 points or 0.7 per cent to 5,494.39. Xstrata ended 2.4 per cent higher at pound(s)12.16 1/2 , while Rio took on 0.9 per cent at pound(s)36.15 and Kazakhmys rose 2.5 per cent to pound(s)14.45. ENRC was the biggest gainer , rising 3.9 per cent to pound(s)10.30 after Kazakhmys said it had no current plans to sell its 26 per cent stake but would look at other options . British Airways was up 1.1 per cent to 194 3/4 p after Credit Suisse chose the airline as its preferred pick in a European sector note . "" BA is the carrier most leveraged to the recovery of the transatlantic market , "" it said . Lloyds Banking Group took on 3.2 per cent to 58 1/2 p amid renewed talk it could sell its insurance business to Resolution .

International Power led the blue-chip fallers , down 3.4 per cent to 311p , on news its talks with GDF-Suez had collapsed . The shares had traded as high as 353 1/2 p in opening trade following reports that GDF was lining up a bid . However , it is thought the talks only related to a merger of assets outside their home markets which would have been funded by International Power stock . A fresh competition threat from BT Group weighed on BSkyB , with the telecoms group saying it will start a price war for sports coverage if the regulator cuts wholesale prices . BT was up 1.3 per cent to 147p . BSkyB lost 1.1 per cent to 567p , even though most analysts said the risk was negligible . BAE Systems slipped 0.9 per cent to 364 3/4 p after Investec started coverage with a "" hold "" rating based on concerns about public spending . "" Sentiment will be the key driver in 2010 , principally the defence market backdrop , with cuts probable , exacerbated in the UK by delays resulting from the general election and Strategic Defence Review , "" the broker said . Among the mid-caps , Logica was down 0.6 per cent to 123 1/2 p following a trade press report that it had botched a deal to supply case-management software at the UK Supreme Court . Panmure Gordon analyst George O'Connor called the reported failure a "" schoolboy error "" at a time when a change of government would likely result in deep cuts to state IT spending . Heritage Oil jumped 7.3 per cent to 524p after a statement from the Kurdish Regional Government boosted hopes its dispute with Iraq over oil revenue may be near a resolution .

17-02-2005,239,"BHP Billiton THE During the technology bubble , analysts would preface their questions on management conference calls by exclaiming "" great quarter , guys ! "" . Similar eulogies are now features of mining company results . As statements of fact , they are undeniable . As share price signals , they are less than comforting . BHP Billiton 's interims yesterday were outstanding . Underlying operating profit rose by 95 per cent year-on-year , some 10 per cent ahead of expectations . Higher prices drove this , while rising costs offset small volume gains . Like Rio Tinto , BHP signalled its optimism by raising its dividend . The new pay-out will consume about 45 per cent of free cashflow - a little below the roughly 60 per cent Rio Tinto is implicitly targeting . Sector momentum is strong . A supply-driven correction is unlikely given the lag between investment and production . Short-term earnings forecasts also use commodity prices below those implied by current futures markets , suggesting further upgrades . Yet as far as demand is concerned , expectations now extrapolate 2004 's exceptional growth - indeed market debate has moved on to the macho concept of a commodity "" super cycle "" . BHP trades at a 30-50 per cent premium to brokers ' estimates of net asset value , which attempt to reflect normalised long-term prices . Those estimates themselves have now risen by 30-40 per cent over the past year . Absolute value is a tricky concept in mining but its link to share prices is becoming fragile .",bhp billiton the
5-11-2010,241,"BHP Billiton / Potash Nothing is resolved , but BHP Billiton 's tilt at PotashCorp already looks like a classic piece of post-crisis mergers and acquisitions . A quick scan of the year 's biggest deals , compared with those of 2007 , shows that opportunities accrue to those with the strongest balance sheets . Investors will tolerate a measure of strategic promiscuity if it comes from a company like BHP , where operating cash flow after interest and tax was more than twice the sum of dividends and net debt in June . Companies do not necessarily have to be better rated ; on average , the top 10 dealmakers in 2007 - many of them banks - had slightly higher credit ratings than 2010 's crop so far . But what they do need is lots of reliable cash-generating assets , and a reputation for using the proceeds wisely . Think triple-B News Corp , trying to mop up minorities in BSkyB , or double-B International Power , merging with GDF Suez . Both have top-quartile returns on invested capital . PotashCorp 's brash defence also shows that targets wo n't give in easily . BHP was offering a 20 per cent premium over the target 's pre-bid share price . That might have worked pre-crisis , when four-fifths of deals were agreed at a premium below 25 per cent . But so far this year that proportion has fallen to two-thirds . Finally , when growth is uncertain and voters are feeling nationalistic , would-be acquirers need to pitch to politicians as much as shareholders . BHP may be able to find a way to get a different result from Canada 's "" net benefit "" test , but the government seems resistant to blandishments . That 's a change ; only once before in the past 35 years has the state rejected an overseas buyer , and that was on the basis of national security .

The strong operating result follows a tough few months for the Anglo-Australian miner which has faced pressure to hand back more cash to shareholders after it failed to complete two large transactions . Its long campaign to combine its iron ore operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia with those of Rio Tinto collapsed in October due to widespread industry opposition . Weeks later it was forced to drop its $39bn hostile bid for Canada 's PotashCorp after failing to win local government backing . BHP 's decision to expand its buy-back programme from $4.8bn to $10bn comes soon after Rio said it would buy back $5bn of its shares after its full-year pre-tax profits surged by 162 per cent to $20.6bn. Xstrata this month more than tripled its dividend as its full-year pre-tax profits rose from $1.53bn to $6.61bn. Marius Kloppers , chief executive , said trading conditions for the mining industry had been particularly good during the six months ending in December , helping to boost BHP 's operating cash flow to "" close to an all-time record "" of $12.2bn. He also acknowledged it would be difficult for BHP to undertake large acquisitions . "" At the current moment where price levels are it makes people who hold those assets relatively ambitious about sales levels , "" he said . "" Putting that together you have a clear take away on our priorities , particularly given the share buy-back programme . "" BHP said its debt free balance sheet would support organic investments exceeding $80bn over five years year , including iron ore and coal projects in Australia , copper in Chile and potash in Canada . The company refused to comment this week on diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks to Australia 's Fairfax Media which claimed that Mr Kloppers believed he derailed China state-owned Chinalco 's $19.5bn investment in Rio Tinto in 2009 . The report said SouthAfrican born Mr Kloppers also feared espionage from China , complained that doing business in Melbourne was akin to "" playing poker when everyone can see your cards "" , and described himself as "" only nominally Australian "" . Mr Kloppers did not directly answer a question on the report during a media call but said fears about surveillance were less of a concern after BHP pushed hard for shorter term market based pricing for commodities .

Cazenove said any benefit from favourable currency movements would be offset by weaker growth and margins in the US .

17-02-2011,247,"BHP buy-back portends slew of shares repurchases Companies devote much energy to persuading investors to buy their shares . So there is a contradiction implicit in share buy-back programmes of the kind pursued by BHP Billiton and GlaxoSmithKline . The mining group has raised the target for its buy-back scheme from $4.8bn to $10bn ( pound(s)6.2bn ) . The pharmaceuticals company plans to repurchase pound(s)2bn of shares this year . Perhaps they should employ disinvestor relations officers to hype the advantages of dumping their stock . There is another cognitive dissonance embodied in a buy-back . A well-run business would surely have better purposes for investors ' capital than returning it . BHP Billiton is less challenged here than GSK . The Melbourne-based group will invest eight times the value of its share repurchases in lucrative mining . Returns from drug discovery have , meanwhile , diminished in parallel with the scope for discovering new blockbusters . Philosophical objections aside , buy-backs make a lot of sense financially . Whittling down a company 's equity base automatically increases earnings per share . Buy-backs also spare remaining shareholders the tax liabilities created by dividend payments . So we should see plenty more this year as surging profits generate spare cash . The last peak was in 2007 , when buy-backs worth pound(s)5.7bn were completed , according to Thomson Reuters . The total for 2010 was just pound(s)1.1bn. Repurchases are more popular with big companies than smaller ones because their larger pools of equity are less prone to price-depressing illiquidity . Growing from a low base , motor insurer Admiral utilised special dividends as an alternative means of returning spare cash to shareholders . One-off pay-backs , in whatever form , are a good way to shed cash without unsettling long-term investors , a breed as prone to nervous shocks as neuralgic maiden aunts . Tweaking the dividend is a more dangerous policy . BHP has not cut its own dividend , which it describes as "" an annuity "" , since the Great Depression . Finally , chief executives love buy-backs for one discreditably egotistical reason . Usually it is their lot to whine impotently about how low the shares are .

23-04-2008,249,"BHP chief launches attack against Rio By REBECCA BREAM and PETER SMITH BHP Billiton 's takeover battle for Rio Tinto moved into increasingly hostile territory yesterday when BHP 's chief executive launched an outspoken attack on his mining rival 's past underperformance and growth prospects . In an interview with the Financial Times at BHP 's Melbourne headquarters , Marius Kloppers rounded on Rio 's chief , saying : "" Tom Albanese has been comprehensively outperformed ( by BHP ) in terms of volume growth , earnings per share growth , total return for shareholders and share price performance . "" On every metric I can envisage they ( Rio ) have been beaten . They have missed the boat on China , they are missing the boat on energy . It must be terrible ( for them ) that every quarter , BHP outperforms , and that has been the case for seven years , "" Mr Kloppers said , adding that he was incredulous that Mr Albanese criticised BHP 's petroleum business last week when the oil price was close to Dollars 115 a barrel . "" Rio are energy-short and they will not benefit from the 80 per cent margin in that ( oil ) business . I do n't know what Tom was thinking , "" Mr Kloppers said . Both sides have escalated their war of words in the weeks since Rio rejected BHP 's offer of 3.4 of its shares for each one of Rio 's , in a takeover worth Dollars 147bn . Both are attempting to win the backing of large and small shareholders , and Mr Kloppers and his advisers have become increasingly irritated by information put into the public domain by Rio . In its results presentation in February , Rio included a slide showing that its production volume would grow at a compound annual rate of 8.6 per cent until 2015 , more than double the 3.9 per cent it forecast for BHP . "" That is not a scorecard , it is a wish list , "" Mr Kloppers said . Rio Tinto said it was "" completely confident "" in its growth claims and said that all the data had been verified .

28-11-2008,251,"BHP claims unity over Rio bid MINING ; Chairman faces questions over job ; AGM 's surprise at demise of merger BHP Billiton has insisted its board voted unanimously to abandon the pursuit of rival Rio Tinto in spite of signs that its chief executive and chairman encountered dissent from non-executive directors , led by David Morgan , the former chief of Westpac Banking Corp. Mr Morgan was described as the man who "" led the charge to stop the Rio deal "" by one shareholder at the Anglo-Australian mining group 's annual meeting in Melbourne yesterday . At the meeting , Don Argus , the chairman , faced repeated questioning about whether he would step down next year and be replaced by Mr Morgan . "" I am not going to speculate on the timing of any replacements of anyone , "" Mr Argus said . "" I have been elected for 12 months "" . Analysts and some shareholders were surprised at BHP 's abrupt U-turn on the Rio takeover given that Mr Argus , and Marius Kloppers , the chief executive and architect of the deal , had promoted it heavily for the best part of a year . "" I am stunned that two people that were so driven on doing this transaction could change their minds so quickly , "" said one shareholder . The Australian Financial Review said Mr Morgan had "" played the role of archconservative "" in the run-up to the board meeting , and was backed by John Schubert , chairman of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia , "" against other more gung-ho directors "" . BHP dismissed the suggestion but said its board discussions were often robust . "" It was a tough decision for the management team , "" Mr Kloppers told the meeting . "" The board was unanimous in their view that completing the transaction was no longer in the best interests of our shareholders . "" BHP highlighted the extent to which markets had moved , particularly in the past month . It said a combined BHP-Rio would have had a market value of $84bn on November 21 and net debt of $78bn , including $30bn for a promised post-takeover share buy-back . That compares with a combined market value of $298bn and net debt of $87bn on February 5 , the day it increased its offer to 3.4 of its shares for every one of Rio's . Rio 's share price had been trading below the level of BHP 's proposed offer since May . Although this boosted BHP management 's confidence that it would win the hostile battle , it also provoked opposition from some BHP shareholders , especially in Australia , who thought that the offer was too generous . BHP 's management has also been criticised for underestimating the European Commission 's objections to the bid for Rio . The Commission 's competition regulator was concerned that a combined BHP-Rio would control too much of the iron ore and coking coal markets , and to win approval for its bid BHP would have had to sell several large mines . BHP admitted when it dropped its bid for Rio on Tuesday that it would have been near impossible to get a good price for these assets in the current tough markets . Mr Kloppers said yesterday that BHP had no plans to cut iron ore production . Credit : By Peter Smith in Sydney and Rebecca Bream in London",bhp claims unity over rio bid
16-07-2007,253,"BHP considers bidding for Alcoa BHP Billiton , the UK-listed miner , has asked Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan to weigh up the merits of it making a bid for Alcoa , the US aluminium group , following rival Rio Tinto 's Dollars 38bn offer for Alcan of Canada . Rio 's offer is the largest takeover bid seen in the mining sector and is expected to trigger a wave of merger and acquisition activity as rival mining companies try to bulk up and avoid being taken over themselves . BHP had been interested in making a bid for Alcan but Rio Tinto 's friendly all-cash offer for the aluminium group , worth Dollars 44bn when debt is included , is above what BHP would consider paying . Attention is now shifting to Alcoa , which made a failed Dollars 27.5bn hostile bid for Alcan in May and is expected to become a take- over target itself . It is understood that BHP , the world 's largest mining company , has asked Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan to examine whether a bid for Alcoa makes sense . The two banks are already BHP'sbrokers . Analysts have said Alcoa is a less attractive target for BHP than Alcan as its aluminium smelters are less efficient and it has lots of downstream assets , such as packaging divisions , that BHP is not interested in . But Alcoa does have a strong position in the mining and refining of aluminium 's raw materials , bauxite and alumina , which would appeal to BHP . BHP 's senior executives are thought to be divided about whether to bid for Alcoa . A person close to the company said that Chip Goodyear , BHP 's outgoing chief executive , would not support a bid unless the deal was a friendly one . The main issue therefore is whether BHP would be willing to make an offer generous enough to win a recommendation from Alcoa 's board . This could in part depend on how much BHP thinks it could raise from spinning off Alcoa 's packaging assets . BHP declined to comment .",bhp considers bidding for alcoa
15-11-2010,255,"BHP ends $39bn pursuit of Potash mining ; Miner reveals scale of undertakings ; Offer had $250m performance bond BHP Billiton has formally ended its three-month pursuit of Saskatchewan 's PotashCorp after failing to secure the Canadian government 's approval for its hostile $39bn bid . The Australian miner coupled the announcement with details of undertakings it had made to Canada in support of the bid , which it described as "" unparalleled in substance , scope and duration "" . They included posting a $250m ( pound(s)155m ) performance bond to assure the government that it would not renege on the commitments , as several other high-profile foreign investors have been accused of doing in recent years . Tony Clement , Canada 's industry minister , blocked the acquisition on November 3 , saying he was not satisfied that it was likely to be of "" net benefit "" to Canada , as required by Ottawa 's foreign investment law . Under the law , BHP had 30 days to make additional representations but Mr Clement made it clear that the government was unlikely to change its mind . He has said he will disclose full reasons for the decision at the end of the 30-day period . The withdrawal marks another costly deal failure for BHP , which in 2008 walked away from its hostile attempt to buy rival miner Rio Tinto . The two companies last month also scrapped a proposed iron ore joint venture in the face of regulatory opposition . BHP said it would record costs of $350m relating to its pursuit of PotashCorp , $250m of which was for the $45bn in debt financing that its banks had organised . While BHP said it would restart its share buy-back programme - it has $4.2bn of its $13bn programme left - people familiar with the miner 's thinking said its acquisition strategy remained unchanged and that it would continue to look for opportunities to diversify , both by commodity and geography . Marius Kloppers , BHP 's chief executive , said in a statement the company had "" an unparalleled portfolio of tier one assets , which we believe can sustain decades of increased production "" . The failure of the bid for PotashCorp is a bitter blow for the two companies ' legion of banks and other advisers . In a year that has seen sluggish mergers and acquisition activity , the deal would have been by far the largest . Mr Clement said in a statement on Sunday that the government "" recognises . . . that there may be ways to improve the [ foreign investment ] review process "" . He added that "" we welcome foreign investment for all the benefits it brings , including new ideas , sources of capital and job creation "" . Besides the performance bond , BHP said it had undertaken to spend $450m on exploration and development over the next five years , in addition to work on the potential Jansen Lake mine in Saskatchewan . It would have spent a further $370m on infrastructure projects , listed its shares on the Toronto stock exchange and set up its global potash headquarters in Saskatoon .

The increase in iron ore output to 28m tonnes in the March quarter from the same time last year outstripped the near 16 per cent quarterly rise to 39m tonnes reported by Rio Tinto recently . It comes as the takeover battle becomes increasingly hostile territory , with both sides talking up their growth prospects . Marius Kloppers , BHP chief executive , made an outspoken attack on his rival 's past underperformance and growth prospects as he updated on trading and rounded on Rio 's chief executive . "" Tom Albanese has been comprehensively outperformed ( by BHP ) in terms of volume growth , earnings per share growth , total return for shareholders and share price performance . "" However , BHP reported mixed production results elsewhere , with quarterly declines in aluminium , copper , nickel and diamonds . The main disappointment was in coking coal , where output dropped 25 per cent after floods in mines in Queensland . Although coal production has resumed , output remains "" constrained "" as the mines move back to full capacity , BHP said . Rio also reported a mixed set of quarterly production figures , which showed its iron ore production in Western Australia had been hit by cyclones and power cuts . BHP , too , has suffered from what Mr Kloppers this week described as "" acts of God "" , including earthquakes in South America and the floods in Queensland . The miner said production of its 12 main commodities rose in the nine months ended in March , with a "" significant increase "" in petroleum . Mr Albanese last week sought to highlight Rio 's dominant position in aluminium against BHP 's "" 60th ranked "" oil and gas business . BHP countered that the petroleum business was one of its strongest and was delivering high margins as oil trades above Dollars 115 a barrel . Its total petroleum product output rose 10 per cent to 93.3m barrels of oil equivalent in the nine-month period , while third-quarter production rose 19 per cent to 32.7m boe . BHP said it was on track to deliver a 10 per cent rise in petroleum volume growth for the full year . Crude oil , condensate and natural gas liquids production increased 13 per cent over the nine months , and 39 per cent over the quarter .

Turnover at BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining company , rose 28 per cent to Dollars 31.8bn ( Pounds 17.7bn ) in the year to June 30 , thanks to higher volumes in many products and rising commodity prices . Pre-tax profit for the year was Dollars 8.7bn , up 92 per cent , in line with expectations . Mr Goodyear said he would use most of the group 's cash flows to invest in growth opportunities , either through acquisitions or new mining projects . The second priority would be preserving a stable balance sheet , with gearing between 35 and 40 per cent , and the third priority was returning cash to shareholders . Those investors hoping BHP would return some cash were frustrated but Chris Lynch , chief financial officer , defended the company 's record in rewarding shareholders . "" We led the way in buy-backs , "" he said . BHP purchased Dollars 1.8bn of its Australia-listed shares in a discounted off-market buy-back last November . BHP also re-based its dividend at its half-year results in February , said Mr Lynch . The group yesterday declared a final dividend of 14.5 cents , making a total of 28 cents , up 7.7 per cent , payable from earnings per share of 104.5 cents ( 54.3 cents ) . Profit at BHP has been driven by strong demand for iron ore , coal and copper from China , where rapid industrialisation is taking place . China is now BHP 's largest customer , with 12.6 per cent of sales . BHP 's carbon steel materials division , which includes its iron ore operations , was the company 's star with profit doubled to Dollars 2.8bn.

23-07-2009,273,"BHP points to inventory adjustments mining Commodity buying patterns in both China and the developed economies of Europe and North America point to a modest improvement in demand , according to BHP Billiton , the world 's largest mining company . In its quarterly production report , BHP , whose large scale and array of commodities make it a bellwether for resources demand , was cautious in painting any broad picture of supply and demand across metals and regions . The outlook was distorted , BHP said , by large adjustments in inventory levels , as some economies restock commodities and others destock . But in China , BHP noted , "" inventory build is essentially complete "" . This implies that the country 's recent build-up of metals might be on the verge of stabilising at a more moderate rate , sustained by underlying demand . China 's inventory build-up has been linked to the steady rise in the copper price in recent months . In North America , Europe and Japan , "" we are now seeing evidence that re-stocking has commenced "" , BHP said . These countries , BHP suggests , are replenishing their depleted stocks in anticipation of future demand , much as China has done in recent months . In the quarter from April to June , BHP 's iron ore production fell 10 per cent to 27m tonnes compared with the same quarter last year . This compares with rival Rio Tinto 's 8 per cent second-quarter rise to 45.1m tonnes . Iron ore production dropped because of expansion projects as well as a series of accidents and a safety review that is causing cutbacks , BHP said . The drop was in line with analyst expectations . BHP and Rio are seeking regulatory clearance to combine their Pilbara iron ore operations in Western Australia . The venture would become the world 's largest producer of seaborne iron ore and was valued by UBS at up to $126bn ( pound(s)77bn ) . In the 12 months to June , BHP 's iron ore output rose 2 per cent to a record 114.4m tonnes , although that result was below its forecast earlier this year for output of 130m tonnes . Copper production continued to slide because of problems at the star Escondida mine in Chile . But this was offset by improved output at the Olympic Dam mine in Australia . Production of 307,000 tonnes marked a 21 per cent drop year-on-year , but a 9 per cent gain on the previous quarter , and the annual output of 1.2m tonnes was a record . The company will report full-year results on August 12 . Reuters ' consensus forecasts see revenue dropping from $57.8bn to $52.3bn , and pre-tax profits falling from $24.2bn to $12.3bn.

20-10-2011,275,"BHP production hits record levels BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining company by market capitalisation , has joined rival Rio Tinto in boosting quarterly production of iron ore to record levels , lifting output of the mineral used in steelmaking by almost a quarter . Improvements to its rail infrastructure in Australia helped BHP largely meet market expectations with a 24 per cent year-on-year rise in production of the commodity , the biggest contributor to group profit , to 39.6m tonnes . The jump comes even as benchmark iron ore prices come under pressure on fears about weakening demand from China , the world 's biggest iron ore consumer , whose economy is growing at the slowest pace in two years . Spot iron ore hit a fresh low for the year this week of $150 a tonne . However , BHP 's production of base metals fell . Copper output dashed expectations with a 24 per cent drop .

11-02-2010,277,"BHP reaffirms iron ore link-up with Rio mining ; ' Nothing close ' to rivalling plan 's value ; Group profits beat consensus forecasts BHP Billiton said yesterday that no potential acquisition target offers anything close to the value of its proposed iron ore venture with Rio Tinto , its nearest rival . In its half-year results to December 31 , the cash-rich miner continued to set itself apart from the hard-hit mining sector with profits higher than consensus forecasts . It paid a dividend of 42 cents per share , one cent higher than the interim period last year . Earnings per share more than doubled from 47 cents to 110.3 cents . BHP 's net cash balance of $8.4bn remained plump , although lower than the $10.8bn on June 30 . The group drew criticism from analysts who think BHP should use the cash to buy a large company . Names such as Potash Corp of Canada , Woodside Petroleum of Australia and BG of the UK have been mentioned . But Alex Vanselow , chief finance officer , said that in the wider market "" nothing comes close "" to rivalling the value of combining Rio and BHP 's iron ore operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia . That proposal , first announced in June 2009 , is under scrutiny by European competition officials . "" Rio was the only one worth [ pursuing ] "" , Mr Vanselow said , referring to a hostile takeover battle that BHP abandoned in November 2008 . "" We tried that . What was the part of Rio that was worth the most ? The Pilbara . That is what we 're getting . "" Rio and BHP expect approval for their joint venture company , whose value has been estimated at $116bn , in the second half of 2010 . If it is approved in the face of strong opposition from steelmakers , BHP will owe Rio an "" equalisation payment "" estimated at about $5.8bn. That is one reason why so much cash remains on its books , said Marius Kloppers , chief executive . "" We are a relatively conservative value proposition , "" Mr Kloppers said in a conference call . "" Given the relative growth in our capital expenditure , the bill we have got to pay Rio and the relatively volatile outlook on the market , we are satisfied about where we are . "" The group 's share buy-back programme was not reinstated , and Mr Vanselow said he would buy back shares when it was clear that the global economy had recovered . Base metals , iron ore and coking coal businesses performed ahead of market estimates , while the petroleum division disappointed due to lower oil and natural gas prices . BHP 's net debt stood at $7.9bn at the end of 2009 and its gearing ratio was 15 per cent . By contrast Xstrata , a smaller mining group , on Monday revealed net debt of $12.3bn and gearing of 26 per cent , about the gearing that analysts expect for Rio Tinto when it reports today . BHP and Rio 's key argument for their joint venture is that it is "" operations-only "" . They would jointly own a company that would control about 40 per cent of the global seaborne iron ore market but would sell the iron ore separately . Pre-tax profits rose from $6.9bn last time to $8.9bn in the half year to December . Revenues fell to $22.2bn from $25.4bn. BHP shares fell 1.5 per cent to pound(s)18.57.

24-01-2008,279,"BHP responds to Rio with record output By REBECCA BREAM and PETER SMITH BHP Billiton , the mining company , has reported record production figures for a number of commodities including iron ore , mirroring a similarly strong performance at takeover target Rio Tinto , which published production figures last week . BHP said it had achieved "" record or equal record production "" in seven commodities in the six months to December . That comes two weeks before a UK Takeover Panel deadline for the AngloAustralian mining group to either table a firm offer for Rio Tinto or walk away for at least six months . In November , BHP approached Rio with a take-over proposal offering three BHP shares for each Rio share , worth about Pounds 65bn , which was rejected . There was mounting speculation yesterday that BHP would make a decision on whether to launch a formal bid at a board meeting in Melbourne next Wednesday . The company would not confirm whether a meeting was scheduled , however , and said : "" No decision has been made on the course of action . "" Sources close to BHP said the company could convene a board meeting to make a decision on Rio "" at any time "" . It is looking increasingly likely that BHP will wait until February 6 to make its move , the final deadline set by the Takeover Panel and the same day as the company 's half-year results . BHP has been keen to highlight the strength of its business at a time when Rio has set out a robust defence of it remaining independent . Michael Rawlinson at Liberum Capital said BHP 's production figures were strong , with the key divisions of iron ore and copper "" performing well "" . But he said the figures did not change the relative positions of BHP and Rio , adding that BHP would have to improve the terms of its three-for-one takeover proposal to win control of Rio . "" A bump will still be necessary to win this prize - something that we feel the hungry BHP has the requisite desire to deliver , "" Mr Rawlinson said . BHP said strong markets allowed it to notch up records in petroleum - including natural gas - alumina , copper concentrate , iron ore , manganese ore and alloy . Its Western Australia iron ore business recorded its eighth consecutive production record . Iron ore production rose 9 per in the second quarter and was up 8 per cent in the latest half . Petroleum rose 10 per cent in the quarter and by 5 per cent in the half . Alumina was flat on the quarter , but rose 4 per cent during the half , while aluminium was flat in both the quarter and half . However , energy coal slipped by 2 per cent in the half year , while nickel production , hit by the shutdown of smelters , was down 11 per cent over the same period .

BHP , already the world 's largest mining group , is attempting to become an even more powerful global force as it attempts to secure rival Rio Tinto via a hostile all-share takeover offer worth about $170bn ( pound(s)85m ) . The outcome of the takeover will not be known until next year as BHP seeks regulatory clearance . Record demand for iron ore and coal from fast-growing nations led by China and India , and record prices for oil , will contribute billions in dollars in profits to BHP in the financial period ended June 30 .

Rio Tinto The cancellation of the buy-back programme , which was extended from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 10bn in February , comes as the UK Takeover Panel is about to set a deadline for BHP to either launch a bid for Rio Tinto or to walk away for at least six months . That deadline is expected to be set as early as tonight or tomorrow , giving BHP until late January or February to show its hand . The world 's largest miner said in spite of market speculation about its takeover proposal for Rio Tinto , it had continued with its buy-back programme . BHP stressed that the buy-back programme was independently managed by BNP Paribas under an irrevocable mandate and a fixed term . BHP said that the mandate ended on Friday . UK Takeover Panel rules state that a company can not renew a buy- back mandate during an offer period because it is in the possession of market sensitive information . Rio Tinto said yesterday that it was pleased that the buy-back had been terminated as it had been a matter of concern for them ever since BHP 's proposal was made public . It said the buy-back scheme may have artificially buoyed the value of BHP 's proposed takeover offer . BHP rejects that criticism , saying that the irrevocable mandate had to run until it expired . According to Ivor Reis , an analyst with stockbroker EL&C Baillieu , on-market buy-backs are not irrevocable and regardless of whether BHP gave the buy-back to a third party to manage , every company has the right to change instructions to the broker to alter or pull the buy-back at any time "" If BHP is in the thick of contemplating any type of material transaction and move beyond a certain point Australian listing requirements demand they must discontinue the buy-back , "" he said . BHP last month approached Rio Tinto with an all-share takeover proposal worth about Dollars 127bn which Rio Tinto this month rejected as too low .

16-11-2010,291,"BHP urged not to rush into more deals mining BHP Billiton shareholders have called on chief executive Marius Kloppers not to rush into further blockbuster acquisition attempts after the miner spent $350m ( pound(s)217m ) on its aborted bid for Canada 's PotashCorp . BHP , which on Monday formally scrapped its $39bn pursuit of the fertiliser producer after the Canadian government blocked the deal , said it would restart its $13bn share repurchase scheme . But the world 's largest mining company is expected to continue seeking ways to diversify through takeovers . A number of top-10 BHP investors told the FT that a buy-back plan was either always their preferred option over the PotashCorp bid , or a way to redistribute its $12bn cash pile that would have been welcomed whether or not the deal completed . Several shareholders also argued that BHP should put any further plans for transformational acquisitions on hold for the moment , citing the $350m in fees - $250m of which were for the $45bn in debt financing arranged by BHP 's banks - as a hefty price for a failed deal . "" Marius is clearly committed to a strategy of large-scale mergers and acquisitions , but the message needs to get across to him to strongly reconsider whether that is always in the best interests of investors , "" one shareholder said . "" I do not want them to be trawling around the world forever trying to find ways of spending my money - the company needs to get the message now , as a lot of shareholders are saying they are flogging a dead horse . "" BHP , according to its 2009 annual report , incurred costs of $357m relating to its failed hostile bid for Rio Tinto , making the PotashCorp approach the second time that an unsuccessful takeover has incurred transaction fees larger than the market capitalisations of many midsized mining companies . Another shareholder said : "" $350m is a very large figure for something that has never really got off the ground . If you can execute [ transformational deals ] then fine , but to do them effectively is very hard , so they need to be careful . "" BHP 's decision to drop the bid had been anticipated widely by the company 's investors and analysts , who for two weeks have been speculating about what target the company might chase next . In investor meetings before the Potash bid was unveiled Mr Kloppers said BHP was interested in oil and gas , agricultural fertilisers and platinum group metal assets . The company 's belief in diversification across the commodities may focus its attentions on its oil and gas business , whose value as a counter-cyclical buffer was apparent in BHP 's earnings stability through the financial crisis . Some investors have argued that the company should increase its buy-back programme - of which $4.2bn of a $13bn planned spend remains - or pay a larger dividend . But others expressed concern over BHP spending too much of its spare cash , as the collapse in commodities prices in the second half of 2008 forced indebted rivals such as Rio Tinto and Xstrata into emergency equity issuance . "" Ultimately , the cash belongs to shareholders , whether it stays in the company or is given back , "" an investor said .

BHP also attempted to soothe fears among steelmakers , especially its customers in China , that the enlarged mining group would wield unrivalled pricing power in the iron ore market . Rio yesterday repeated its rejection of BHP 's offer of three of its shares for every one Rio share , and said its shareholders supported its rejection . But in a direct appeal to shareholders , BHP published details of its offer and set out the logic for the takeover , which it said was "" unrivalled "" . Marius Kloppers , BHP chief executive , said it would launch a Dollars 30bn share buy-back after completing the deal so that the combined group 's shareholder base would match the location of its assets . The buy-back would be aimed at UK-listed BHP Billiton shares , rather than Australia-listedshares , in an effort to keep about half of the shareholder base in Australia . One analyst said BHP was using the prospect of a buy-back to boost its share price and make its offer for Rio look more attractive . Mr Kloppers denied that a takeover of Rio by BHP was based on a desire to have greater sway over prices in the iron ore market , almost 40 per cent of which would be controlled by the combined entity . He said that putting together BHP and Rio 's iron ore assets in Western Australia would allow some projects to be accelerated . The output of iron ore could increase by 10 per cent . Mr Kloppers declined to say whether BHP was ready to go hostile in its bid for Rio , but said investors might support the deal even if Rio management did not .

At a shareholder meeting in Perth on Tuesday , Jac Nasser , BHP chairman , defended the Anglo-Australian miner 's management team led by Marius Kloppers , chief executive , who has faced criticism for the cost of failed deals and wasting management time . BHP has incurred almost $900m in costs for failed deals since Mr Kloppers took the helm in 2007 . "" No pain , no gain with a lot of these transactions , "" Mr Nasser said in the group 's first public comments since walking away from PotashCorp . "" We are one of few companies in the world that can look at such large transactions . "" BHP responded to regulatory opposition to its proposed Western Australian iron ore joint venture with Rio Tinto by jettisoning the deal last month . In 2008 , BHP abandoned its hostile bid for a then debt-laden Rio Tinto as the global financial crisis deepened . Some BHP shareholders have called on Mr Kloppers to hold off on such transformational acquisitions . They railed against the fees the miner had incurred and urged the group to extend share buy-backs beyond its planned $13bn . Shareholders at the Perth meeting agreed to extend for another year a new round of share buy-backs in 2011 , giving BHP the option to acquire more than $8bn of its shares . The mining group has a solid balance sheet with net debt falling to $3.3bn at the year end after it generated net operating cash flow of $18bn in 2009-10 . John Campbell , from the Australian Shareholders ' Association , told the meeting that management time had been diverted from "" more profitable activities "" and said the collapse of the iron ore joint venture had cost BHP $350m . But Mr Nasser said BHP had an obligation to pursue transactions that could create shareholder value . "" I do not see it as wasted cost , "" he said . "" There has been no distraction . The management has been able to look at these transactions while at the same time improving value for shareholders . "" Mr Nasser dismissed a US report that claimed BHP was to focus on smaller companies . "" We 're not going to change our strategy from looking at large tier-one quality assets . "" *PotashCorp said on Tuesday it was launching a $2bn stock buyback to support its share price .

Tesco is expected to announce Mr Brasher 's departure this morning . Philip Clarke , group chief executive , will take over the running of the retailer 's domestic operations . Mr Brasher , a long-serving director at the company who has been UK chief for just a year , was due to address a high profile industry conference today . His departure comes in the wake of a profit warning in January after Tesco recorded its worst trading over the crucial Christmas period for decades . The move comes after reports of longstanding tensions between Mr Clarke and Mr Brasher . The pair were said to have clashed over Tesco 's flagship pound(s)500m price cutting programme , which has failed to revive sales . Mr Brasher wanted to go further with the price cuts , but this was resisted by Mr Clarke and Laurie McIlwee , finance director , who wanted to preserve profit . In an interview with the Financial Times last week , Mr Clarke denied there were any tensions between himself and Mr Brasher . Tesco declined to comment . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , said the move "" shows assertiveness by Clarke to take the bull by the horns , albeit the capability for him to be group chief executive and head of the UK is debatable "" . The management changes come amid early signs that a programme of aggressive voucher promotions has begun to stimulate sales growth . Mr Brasher is the third Tesco board director to leave since Mr Clarke succeeded Sir Terry Leahy a year ago in the biggest management transition at Tesco for 14 years . Andrew Higginson , head of Tesco 's retailing services division which includes Tesco bank , and David Potts , the Tesco veteran running Asia , have both stepped down . Lucy Neville-Rolfe , legal and corporate affairs director , is also expected to step down this year . The move comes as Mr Clarke puts the finishing touches to a recovery plan for the UK business that is expected to hit profits by pound(s)457m , wiping out any growth this year .

21-11-2012,299,"British Land The cranes stare at each other across the City of London from the top of skyscrapers that they seem to be pulling out of the ground . On one side is British Land 's Cheesegrater , one-third pre-let , largely to US insurance group Aon . On the other is Land Securities ' Walkie Talkie , a quarter pre-let to a collection of other insurers . It is not only a passion for glitzy developments that unites companies . They also offer very similar investment propositions , with pound(s)10bn portfolios focused on UK retail and London offices . Land Securities enjoys the higher rating . Its shares trade at a 10 per cent discount to forecast net asset value , against 13 per cent for British Land . That partly reflects the latter 's higher debt - 46 per cent of its portfolio is financed by debt , against 36 per cent for Land Securities . Although interest payments are comfortably covered by income , the debt-inspired property crash of 2008 still casts a shadow over the sector . But first-half results from both during the past two weeks suggest there is reason for a more generous stance towards British Land . First its retail portfolio , which accounts for 60 per cent of the total , is performing slightly better than its rival 's . In tough conditions , it limited the decline in value to 1 per cent over the half , against a fall of almost 3 per cent at Land Securities . And it has been shifting the balance of its office portfolio , with the West End ( where rents are higher ) now accounting for a half . British Land has also been taking advantage of low interest rates to refinance debt , recently completing a convertible issue at a coupon of just 1.5 per cent . The result is that its cost of debt is 4.4 per cent , which is 70 basis points below Land Securities ' . Add that to the valuation discount and a dividend yield that , at 5.1 per cent , will attract income investors , and British Land looks the more attractive of the two .",british land
8-02-2008,301,"British Land admits the extent of its losses By DANIEL THOMAS and MAGGIE URRY British Land has become the first major property company to reveal the extent of the property downturn after admitting yesterday that more than Pounds 1.3bn had been wiped off its portfolio . The UK 's second largest property company reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.32bn in the last quarter after a 16.7 per cent drop in its net asset per share to Pounds 14.01. Its property was marked down 8.9 per cent . The speed of the adjustment of valuations augured well for a shorter downturn , the company said . "" Macro-economic uncertainty and the global credit crunch have depressed property values , "" said chairman Chris Gibson-Smith . "" However , the worst should be behind us , though uncertainties remain on timing and extent of the correction . "" The portfolio value stood at Pounds 18.4bn at the end of December . British Land reassured on its retail and office development pipeline . Completions in 2007 and 2008 were 74 per cent pre-let , sold or under offer , it said . Like-for-like rental value growth of 5 per cent beat the Investment Property Databank benchmark of 3.4 per cent , and leasing activity "" remained good "" . The company has sold Pounds 600m of property since September , and expects to continue to sell more low-growth assets . It could revisit the partial sale of Meadowhall , pulled last year . Its largest single holding , the Broadgate estate in Liverpool Street , fell 9.3 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn. Underlying pre-tax profit rose 12.5 per cent to Pounds 72m for the quarter , while underlying earnings per share rose 16.7 per cent . The company 's debt is fixed at 5.28 per cent and over an average maturity of 12.6 years . It has a further Pounds 2bn in committed undrawn bank lines available . British Land 's property portfolio has fallen broadly in line with losses throughout the property industry in the past six months . "" The losses are as expected but the tone from management is much more optimistic , "" said Harm Meijer , analyst at JPMorgan . Lombard , Page 18",british land admits the extent of its losses
16-08-2006,303,"British Land aims ever higher as rents climb REAL ESTATE British Land looks set to build the Leadenhall Building , a 48- storey tower in the City , after seeing signs of a stronger occupier market . Stephen Hester , chief executive , said he was "" 80 per cent confident "" that the group would build the 736ft skyscraper , set to be one ofBritain 's tallest once finished in 2010 . The company is powering ahead with various office developments in London covering 3.5m sq ft. They include The Broadgate Tower and 201 Bishopsgate , two adjacent buildings to the north of the Broadgate estate , due for completion by 2008 . Mr Hester said he was confident about London rents , having achieved Pounds 50 per sq ft in a recent letting at Broadgate - a figure not seen there since 2001 . Property experts have been falsely calling a pick-up in the London occupier market for years but Mr Hester said office vacancy levels were now falling , with signs of rental growth . Elsewhere , the company - led by long-standing chairman Sir John Riblat who is set to retire next January - has been selling high street shops and regional offices while buying London offices and retail parks . This strategy appeared vindicated yesterday as the group reported a 3.6 per cent uplift in the value of its retail warehouses and a 4.8 per cent rise in City offices during the first quarter . Total assets rose 3.5 per cent to Pounds 15.15bn. Net asset value ( NAV ) per share rose 7.1 per cent to Pounds 15.92 ( Pounds 14.86 on March 31 ) in the three months to June 30 , ahead of analysts ' forecasts . Underlying pre-tax profit rose 33 per cent from the previous quarter to Pounds 77m ( Pounds 55m ) , helped by an Pounds 18m dividend from the company 's 17 per cent stake in Songbird , the Canary Wharf vehicle . Underlying earnings per share were 11p ( 9p ) . FT Comment *British Land 's NAV continues to rise on the winds of the broader investment boom . It is a sign of the hot market when the group 's portfolio is valued on a yield of 4.8 per cent while its cost of debt is 5.4 per cent . Stephen Hester believes he has tweaked the group to outperform when those winds change direction . First , there is the strong pipeline of office developments , which will be profitable - if let - even if London rents do not rise . Second , British Land has bought into retail parks that , though pricey , promise stronger rental growth than other shops . British Land , at a share price of Pounds 13.71 , down 5p yesterday , is trading at a 16 per cent discount to NAV of Pounds 15.92. Taking into account the charge of 60p a share to become a Reit in January and a 34p charge for last month 's Pounds 1bn refinancing , effective NAV is about Pounds 15 . On this measurement , its shares are at a discount to NAV of 8 per cent - perhaps as a result of BL 's low yield . Yet the price could rise in the next year if some analysts ' predictions of 10 per cent NAV growth come true .",british land aims ever higher as rents climb real estate

The company 's property portfolio climbed 1.4 per cent to pound(s)8.7bn in the three months to June 30 , its first financial quarter , down considerably from the 16 per cent rise in the previous two quarters when the bounce in the market was at its height . Profit before tax dropped to pound(s)171m , against pound(s)630m in the previous quarter . British Land warned that the near-term outlook for the property sector was uncertain , although it said that it remained confident about long-term prospects for the business . Chris Grigg , chief executive , said : "" We will get a period where we will bump along but I feel confident about our properties . "" Prime [ property ] will remain in good shape compared with secondary assets . Rents will be stronger in London than in retail and we should see that trend coming through in rental values . "" The news of a slowdown in the growth of its portfolio , which saw net asset value per share rise from 504p to 515p , helped push the shares down 12.4p to 457.1p , although the company reassured investors that operationally it was still on track with estimated rental values ( ERV ) up 0.7 per cent . ERV in the London office portfolio rose 2.4 per cent , reflecting the strength of recent lettings in the City and West End , but fell 0.2 per cent in the retail portfolio . The company will maintain its quarterly dividend at 6.5p. British Land this week agreed to develop a 700,000 sq ft office building for UBS on the existing site of 4 and 6 Broadgate , which it owns in a joint venture with Blackstone , boosting rental income and extending the weighted average lease term . The news will strengthen fears that the commercial property market could be heading for a second dip in values later this year , having seen values bounce surprisingly strongly since hitting a floor last summer . Jones Lang LaSalle 's quarterly index showed that all-property total returns slowed to 3.6 per cent in the second quarter , against 6.2 per cent in the previous quarter , while capital value growth decreased to 2 per cent .

9-04-2009,315,"British Land in Broadgate sale talks real estate ; Negotiations for half of pound(s)2.5bn estate ; Company aims to rebalance portfolio British Land is in talks to sell half of its pound(s)2.5bn Broadgate office estate in the City of London to private equity investors as part of efforts to raise cash and rebalance its property portfolio . The company is locked in negotiations with the Macquarie-backed Australian fund manager MGPA about a partial sale of the office campus , one of the supposedly "" sacred cow "" legacy assets from its dealmaking during the last recession . Broadgate was valued at more than pound(s)2.5bn at the company 's last set of results for the third quarter to December 31 , although any deal would likely see the estate have a value of nearer pound(s)2.3bn. The estate is financed through a single pound(s)2.1bn securitisation structure and it is likely that any deal would see MGPA assume half of this debt , with a low amount of additional equity needed . Those close to the negotiations emphasised that these are still at an early stage . British Land has also had approaches from other potential partners and has held talks with other US private equity investors . Delancey , the fund manager headed by Sir John Ritblat , the former British Land chief executive , has also been interested , although it is understood to view British Land 's price as too high . Some analysts believe the value of the estate could be nearing that of its debt , which would mean that almost any equity would be wiped out . The sale process , which is being overseen by Chris Grigg , recently appointed chief executive , follows a wider recapitalisation of the British Land balance sheet . The company has raised pound(s)740m through a rights issue and has been selling other assets , such as half of its Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield to London & Stamford . It has recently sold Abbey 's London headquarters to Santander , the bank 's owner . It has an untapped debt facility of more than pound(s)2.5bn that can be used to buy when the market recovers , although it needs equity to unlock the facilities . Shares in British Land closed up 28 1/4 p at 418 1/2 p , partly owing to a sectoral rally on the back of an upgrade from Nomura . Both British Land and MGPA declined to comment when contacted yesterday . Other real estate investment trusts are also looking at raising additional cash through sales .

The company announced the issue alongside a pound(s)1.64bn writedown in the third quarter following a 13 per cent reduction in its property portfolio valuation . "" We 're doing it [ the rights issue ] for two reasons , "" Chris Grigg , chief executive , said yesterday . "" One is to ensure that we 're in a very strong balance sheet position .

Chris Grigg , chief executive , said yesterday that a fall in the number of retailers facing administration had helped boost net income from its retail portfolio by 2.7 per cent in the six months to September 30 , although a 2.3 per cent decline in office income reduced overall like-for-like rental income growth to 0.7 per cent over the period . The company , which last year wrote off more than pound(s)3bn from the value of its estate , saw its net asset value slide by 6.5 per cent over the six months . However , it said NAV had rebounded by 3.1 per cent in the second quarter amid encouraging lettings potential as "" a positive shift in investor appetite combined with limited stock "" benefited market valuations . The company , which is operating a portfolio valued at pound(s)8.3bn compared with pound(s)11.6bn a year ago , ended the six months with NAV per share of 372p , down from 398p at the beginning of the interim period . Mr Grigg said British Land , which last year made disposals as well as tapping shareholders for cash in a bid to pin back net debt to pound(s)4.8bn , was bidding actively for pound(s)500m of properties while another pound(s)2bn remained on its radar . A "" cool pound(s)1bn "" budget freed in September through the sale of a 50 per cent stake in the Broadgate development in London would be used to target better investment opportunities during the next two years , he said . "" When we see attractive opportunities to put in bids , we will - the highest proportion from the pound(s)500m [ under current bid ] is in retail , and about a quarter in offices , "" said Mr Grigg . But Mr Grigg insisted British Land would "" be patient and act in a disciplined manner "" as it rebuilt its portfolio . "" The refinancing overhang and the balance sheet exposures of the banks nonetheless remain structural issues , which will weigh on values over the medium term , "" he added .

10-02-2010,323,"British Land portfolio value bounces real estate ; Estate 's worth rises 8.2 % to nearly pound(s)8bn ; Group has no swift development plans British Land , the UK 's second biggest property company , reported a strong bounce in the value of its estate during the third quarter to pound(s)8bn , as the real estate recovery began to feed into the balance sheets of the listed sector . The company reported a net asset value of 438p for the third quarter , a jump of 18 per cent , which led to a profit of pound(s)611m , compared with a loss of pound(s)1.6bn last year . The value of its properties increased 8.2 per cent to almost pound(s)8bn . Earnings per share were 60p , compared with a loss per share of 470p in the period last year . The company has spent pound(s)121m on properties since last September , including a half stake in Surrey Quays shopping centre in London . British Land has pound(s)2.8bn of undrawn debt and pound(s)342m of cash . Chris Grigg , chief executive , said the company was well-positioned to take advantage as further attractive assets emerged over the next 18 months . Mr Grigg said there were no plans to "" push the button "" on any new developments , in spite of a large potential pipeline and plans at rival real estate investment trusts , although it would refurbish two buildings at Broadgate as part of plans to update the 1980s office estate with its new partner , Blackstone . Mr Grigg also said there were no regrets about selling half of the pound(s)2bn Broadgate estate to Blackstone last summer in spite of the rise in value . He said the move was a "" long-term strategy decision "" for an asset that required a significant amount of capital expenditure . There are also 750,000 sq ft of extensions to retail parks being reviewed . Rental values declined - by 0.5 per cent for retail assets and by 1.2 per cent for offices - although the rate has eased . There was like-for-like income growth of 1.4 per cent , however , and the company confirmed 272,000 sq ft of office space was under offer to new tenants . Occupancy remained strong at 94 per cent overall , with retail properties at 99 per cent . The company will pay a third-quarter dividend of 6.5p. Shares closed up 12p at 450p . * FT Comment British Land is well-placed to continue to benefit from the real estate recovery with a geared portfolio of well-let prime London and retail assets . While trading at a premium of 3 per cent to the reported NAV , the shares stand at a discount to forward looking estimates , suggesting there is still upside . Even so , it has done nothing in particular to drive returns above the market recovery , and a management bolstered by two new experienced board members needs to be more active with its cash , given changing market conditions . If nothing else , it needs earnings to ensure there is no dividend deterioration in future . Credit : By Daniel Thomas , Property Correspondent",british land portfolio value bounces
24-05-2006,325,"British Land sees end to property boom REAL ESTATE The commercial property boom of recent years is likely to peter out soon , according to Stephen Hester , chief executive of British Land . Growth rates were set to slow , although a crash was very unlikely , Mr Hester said as he unveiled a surge in profit and asset values in the year to March 31 . A rise in bond yields in recent months has hit indebted buyers and taken the edge off the property market in Europe and the US . "" The property market is more vulnerable than in recent years to setbacks should interest rate go higher , "" said Mr Hester . Shares in British Land rose 81p yesterday to Pounds 12.44 as the property company confirmed expectations that it was likely to become a real estate investment trust ( Reit ) next year . It will pay more than Pounds 300m to the Treasury to become a Reit , a tax- efficient property vehicle , in return for paying no corporation tax . Its dividend yield is set to rise by a minimum of 45 per cent to more than 2 per cent . British Land is set to sell much of its remaining 78 high street shops , valued at Pounds 370m . Instead it will focus on out-of-town retail parks , where rental growth is expected to be stronger . It will set up a fund for Meadowhall , its underperforming shopping centre in Sheffield , so it can reduce its ownership . Adjusted diluted net asset value rose 32 per cent to Pounds 14.86 ( Pounds 11.28 ) . Underlying profit was up 26 per cent to Pounds 228m ( Pounds 181m ) . A total dividend of 17p ( 15.7p ) will be paid from underlying earnings per share of 36p ( 27p ) . Of this , the final dividend is 11.8p ( 10.9p ) . FT Comment *British Land has been hyperactive , trading Pounds 4.8bn of property in a year . Yesterday 's headline data may have beaten analysts ' consensus but the Net Asset Value increase was flattered by the company 's high gearing . The underlying portfolio saw a valuation rise of 13.5 per cent , less than the industry average ( based on IPD ) of 14.6 per cent . It also undershot main rival Land Securities at 15.3 per cent . Shareholders will be crossing their fingers that City office rents rise in the next few years to buoy British Land 's 2.5m sq ft pipeline of new developments . There were no real surprises on the Reit front but the company group looks cheap if it fulfils analysts ' forecasts of post-Reit NAV at Pounds 15.24 - a prospective discount of 20 per cent .",british land sees end to property boom real estate

Marius Kloppers , chief executive of BHP Billiton , said the takeover , valued at about $127bn ( pound(s)68bn ) made "" more sense than ever "" as rising labour and fuel costs begin to put pressure on industry profit margins . The world 's biggest miner reported a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from $19.2bn to $23.5bn in the year to June 30 as it benefited from record production in several commodities as well as strong demand in China , cost cuts and a focus on high-margin growth projects . This was the seventh consecutive year of record profits .

The common denominator is that the good performers have tailored their services to the local market . Tesco , the UK supermarket group , has enjoyed success with the help of Samsung , its local partner . Samsung Tesco 's HomePlus has become Korea 's second largest outlet behind E-Mart . The venture reported Dollars 4.6bn in sales last year from its 40 stores , commanding a 17.1 per cent market share . Since Tesco entered the Korean market in 1999 , it has gone a long way towards localising its service . Beyond the shopping floors , there are fast-food bars , coffee shops and restaurants in the hypermarkets . Tesco has set up in most of its Korean stores an internet cafe , a financial service centre and a car-repair shop . Shoppers can visit an in-house art gallery and attend a class held in the community centre . General Motors has done well . The US carmaker took over bankrupt Daewoo Motors in 2002 , and has turned it round . GM now uses all of the former Daewoo facilities and is designing new models in Korea . GM Daewoo Auto & Technology has become one of the most successful overseas operations of GM . The venture 's sales more than doubled to 1.16m cars last year and increased 53 per cent to 476,000 units in the first four months of this year , overtaking Kia Motors as Korea 's second largest carmaker after Hyundai . GM Daewoo won the respect of Korean consumers when it rehired all 1,600workers laid off by the old Daewoo and announced plans to buy a former Daewoo plant that was excluded from the original acquisition deal . "" This is a case where they have built up the capabilities of the company because the Korean staff had the education , background and skill necessary to produce modern car designs and to manufacture them , "" says Hank Morris at Industrial Research and Consulting . IBM , Hewlett-Packard and Motorola have made strides in Korea . IBM Korea is reporting about Dollars 1bn in annual sales even after disposing of its PC business , and Hewlett-Packard Korea 's annual turnover is roughly Dollars 1.4bn. Motorola 's Razr mobile phones are popular in Korea , after years of weak performance for the company . "" There are certainly some good success stories of foreign companies here . They have been adaptable and aggressive in finding out what the local market needs and how they can manage their business from Korea , "" says Hank Morris at Industrial Research and Consulting , the Korean consultancy .","but tesco, gm and motorola buck the trend by keeping their ears to the ground"
6-06-2006,335,"Buyerless network Vodafone It 's a painful question , but here goes : is Vodafone , the acquisition machine , now itself a takeover candidate ? Its market capitalisation of Dollars 140bn ranks ninth in the world . After August 's jumbo dividends this falls to Dollars 119bn - and 34th place . If Vodafone , as its critics demand , then sold its stake in Verizon wireless and distributed the post-tax proceeds , its value would drop to about Dollars 85bn . That is outside the world 's top 50 companies and comparable to Barclays and AstraZeneca , two of the UK market 's favourite takeover candidates . Further , Vodafone is unpopular with some investors and trades on a low 2006 earnings multiple of 12 times . In spite of this , a takeover is unlikely . There is no obvious buyer . Most other industry operators have performed badly too . Only AT&T , China Mobile and Verizon would be larger than a Dollars 90bn Vodafone . China Mobile 's ambitions today are modest - it is sniffing around Millicom , an emerging markets shrimp . AT&T has complementary technology but it would be perverse if the market , having chastised Vodafone 's US ambitions , supported expansion in the other direction . Europe 's Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom can be ruled out . Both have large debt loads and two big overlapping networks with Vodafone . Fantasists in the private equity world may dream of breaking Vodafone up , but even at Dollars 90bn it would be too big . Although Vodafone has exited Japan and may leave the US , the concept of a controlled , transnational mobile portfolio retains investor support . Sir John Bond , the new chairman , helped build HSBC into the world 's third most valuable bank . He is an unsentimental but ambitious man who will be keen to exploit a unique asset base . Vodafone 's stature has diminished but if the operator did not exist , someone would still , probably , try to invent it .",buyerless network vodafone
20-10-2010,337,"Canadian province casts doubt on BHP move The Canadian province of Saskatchewan is at odds with BHP Billiton over the Australian miner 's $39bn hostile offer for PotashCorp , raising the prospect that the deal might be rejected by the federal government . A person familiar with the deal said on Tuesday that BHP had offered extra elements valued at about C$370m ( pound(s)228m ) to demonstrate that the deal would be of "" net benefit "" to Canada , as required under the Investment Canada Act . However , the province is holding out for more , specifically a one-off levy to go some way to make up for lost tax revenues that would result from the deal . Brad Wall , the province 's premier , is due to announce his government 's stance on the deal in a speech on Thursday . Saskatchewan does not have the power to veto BHP 's proposal but its views are likely to be influential in the federal government 's consideration of the deal . The federal industry department faces a November 3 deadline to determine whether the deal provides a net benefit . The law allows for another 30 days of negotiation on further commitments . A consultant 's report commissioned by the province concluded that Saskatchewan could lose at least C$2bn in royalties over the next decade if BHP was allowed to acquire the Saskatoon fertiliser producer . The revenue loss stems from provincial tax rules that would allow BHP to write off the cost of developing its Jansen Lake potash project against income generated by PotashCorp 's existing operations . BHP has made several undertakings to assuage public opinion since it unveiled the bid two months ago . They include locating its global potash headquarters in the province .

Shares in Barclays rose 6.4 per cent to 187p , matching a Europewide sector rally , as rumours circulated that it may raise capital to pre-emptively bolster its balance sheet . However , people familiar with Barclays said there was no basis to speculation about a cash call . Conventional means to raise cash , such as a share placing or the sale of its stake in BlackRock , would do little to appease the most bearish commentators on Barclays . Espirito Santo estimated that the bank would need an extra EUR13.6bn to meet the 9 per cent capital threshold planned by the European Banking Authority - equivalent to about half its market value . Instead , dealers attributed Wednesday 's share price strength to short covering . Barclays is one of the few eurozone-exposed banks whose domicile and free float makes short selling both legal and viable , they said . Data Explorers shows that 0.8 per cent of Barclays ' free float is out on loan , up from 0.4 per cent in August and equivalent to just over a day 's average volume .

Had the impact of loyalty vouchers been excluded from the first-quarter performance , sales from stores open for at least a year would have fallen 0.4 per cent and not risen 0.1 per cent as reported . The note could reignite concern over how Tesco treats Clubcard loyalty vouchers , which has become an issue since it doubled rewards under the scheme a year ago . The retailer counts sales paid for with Clubcard vouchers as cash sales , and makes an accounting adjustment for this in its statutory half-year and full-year results . Rivals J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison do not include the vouchers in their sales . Mr Johnston said if more conservative policies were applied across all the areas he highlighted , Tesco 's 2009-10 underlying profit would have fallen from pound(s)3.4bn to pound(s)2.6bn. Tesco said : "" There is nothing untoward with our accounting as Citigroup 's report acknowledges . "" We report in line with statutory guidelines and the accounts are externally audited . The issues discussed in the report have been gone over many times before and do not detract from our strong performance over the last year . "" People close to Tesco believe most of the points have been raised and dealt with in the past . They say it has addressed the issues on the treatment of Clubcard vouchers when it has reported sales and profits . The questions come at a sensitive time for Tesco . Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , is handing over to Phil Clarke next March and the retailer faces challenging trading conditions . It also faces questions from a US union-affiliated investment group at its annual meeting tomorrow on executive remuneration . www.ft.com / ukretail Credit : By Andrea Felsted , Retail Correspondent",citi revisits queries over tesco accounting
2-06-2007,345,"Clues sought in Vodafone price mystery ON LONDON Tony Tassell The UK stock market clearly smells something afoot with Vodafone . The mobile telecommunications group 's share price has jumped 12 per cent in the past two weeks in massive trading volumes . The re-rating has been even more striking given that it has coincided with a set of full-year results that confirmed a long- term trend of deteriorating profit margins and a flat outlook for earnings . The rumour mill has been the obvious catalyst with speculation of a takeover from a US trade buyer , such as AT&T or Verizon , or - almost inevitably in the current market environment - a private equity consortium . Such a deal would have more than a little resonance for stock market historians . Vodafone , which helped define the peak of the last bull market with its acquisition of Mannesmann in 2000 , could be taken out just as the FTSE 100 index is nearing its record heights struck shortly before that deal . But the takeover scenarios have problems as real prospects . Like other mega-caps , Vodafone still looks out of reach for private equity with an enterprise value including net debt of Dollars 200bn . It is also doubtful whether the predator candidates most tipped for Vodafone would bite . AT&T , the world 's largest telecoms group , appears to be looking at only smaller acquisitions . Verizon , which now has a market capitalisation 20 per cent smaller than Vodafone , also faces size and cash flow constraints in doing a big deal , although it could team up with a private equity house . A more intriguing prospect is corporate self-help - that Vodafone could break itself up . It has already sold off operations or stakes in Japan , Belgium and Switzerland at handsome prices . So why not go the whole hog ? This strategy would also have resonance for watchers of stock market cycles . After all , Vodafone itself was spun out of Racal , the conglomerate built up by Sir Ernie Harrison and then progressively broken up to deliver huge rewards to shareholders . Adam Steiner , head of research at Vodafone shareholder SVG Capital , points out that since the beginning of 2005 , there have been more than 400 mobile telecoms deals . He says the valuations on the deals have been remarkably consistent , averaging about 10 times prospective earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ( ebitda ) . Even poorly performing mobile groups went at around this level . But Mr Steiner estimates Vodafone is trading on 5.5 times ebitda , if you exclude its 45 per cent stake in Verizon that SVG values at about Pounds 30bn . This presents a more than interesting arbitrage opportunity . But there are problems , not the least of which is finding buyers for specific operations . There would even be problems selling the Verizon stake , as a deal would incur a large capital gains tax bill . Mr Steiner also argues that while a break-up would realise value , it would not create fundamental value . "" We actually think Vodafone has the right strategy of using its high level of cash generated from its mature operations in Europe to invest in emerging markets , "" he says . Perhaps the issue is more about how public markets should value mature , high cash-generative companies such as Vodafone . The group 's own guidance shows it is trading on a prospective free cashflow yield of 10 per cent if you exclude the Verizon holding . Most private equity groups would be salivating at such a cashflow . History may show these groups are now paying over the odds for assets . But if Vodafone continues to rise without the real prospect of a takeover or break-up , it may indicate a shift by public investors to see the company more through the eyes of a trade buyer or private equity house . In a UK market shrinking as private equity groups take advantage of cheap credit to go on acquisition sprees , that really would have resonance .",clues sought in vodafone price mystery on london tony tassell
4-02-2011,347,"Commodities bill hits Unilever 's margins food producers Unilever yesterday issued a warning that input inflation will cost some 4 per cent of sales , or about EUR1.8bn ( pound(s)1.5bn ) . Higher commodities prices , particularly for edible oils that form a large part of Unilever 's shopping basket , are crimping margins and depressing share prices across the industry . The global food and beverages sector is down 2 per cent in the year to date . However , Paul Polman , chief executive of the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group , is confident cost savings and higher sticker prices will cover the bill . Analysts agreed , saying the 26 per cent increase in operating profit to EUR6.3bn for 2010 showed the company was regaining its competitive edge . Jamie Isenwater , food and beverages analyst at Deutsche Bank , said Unilever 's estimate on input inflation costs were based on visibility over the next six to nine months and "" probably already bake in some conservatism "" . Last year underlying volumes at the maker of Dove soap and Magnum ice- cream rose 5.8 per cent year-on-year , the highest growth in 30 years , which Mr Polman attributed to more innovation in more countries . Unilever reported turn-over of EUR44.3bn , up 11 per cent , with the aid of favourable currency fluctuations . Pre-tax profit rose 25 per cent to EUR6.1bn. Net profit rose 26 per cent to EUR4.6bn , while diluted earnings per share were up 25 per cent to EUR1.46. A fourth-quarter dividend of 17.75p ( 17.04p ) is proposed . "" We continue to live in volatile times , "" said Mr Polman . "" But we believe we are better prepared than ever to meet these challenges . "" Analysts concurred but some pointed to margin compression in the fourth quarter , when underlying operating margins dropped 20 basis points . "" They are only in the foothills of input inflation and already they are struggling to hold margins , "" said Martin Deboo , foods analyst at Investec . "" Our analysis would suggest the number could be bigger than ( the 400 basis points) . "" The shares fell 20p to pound(s)18.37. * FT Comment Unilever 's battle to win over the investment community is slowly bearing fruit - although Mr Polman is under no delusions that he needs to provide further delivery before he has investors fully onside . The numbers stand in stark relief to US peers Procter & Gamble , the world 's largest consumer goods company , and smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive , which both flunked analysts ' targets . Unilever shares are relatively cheap and trade at about 14 times this year 's earnings , but with commodities prices soaring and developed market consumers fragile , manufacturers of consumer goods are not in fashion .

13-03-2009,349,"Delhaize shrugs off Unilever clash Delhaize , the Belgian supermarket group that operates the Food Lion chain in the US , yesterday rebuffed suggestions that a spat with Unilever had damaged its prospects as it unveiled 2008 results that were ahead of market expectations , writes Stanley Pignal in Brussels . Delhaizelast week resolved a month-long dispute with the supplier of brands such as Knorr , Dove and Lynx , which caused Unilever to pull most of its range from Delhaize 's 775 Belgian stores . Pierre-Olivier Beckers , Delhaize 's chief executive , dismissed a marketing agency study that the clash had hurt first-quarter sales . Unilever had taken out a series of ads in the Belgian press , encouraging shoppers to seek its products in rival supermarkets . Delhaize had previously advertised its own labels as alternatives to Unilever products . Andrew Wood , analyst at Bernstein Research , said the spat , which led Delhaize shoppers to go elsewhere , highlights "" the strength of the manufacturers and the brand loyalty that can overshadow retailer pressures "" . The dispute was followed through the retail world as a gauge of how the relationship between suppliers and supermarkets would evolve during the economic downturn . Delhaize is aiming to add between 70 and 80 stores to bring its total to about 2,750 worldwide , 1,600 of which will be in the US . Exposure to the US dollar helped boost fourth-quarter net profit , which rose 30.5 per cent to EUR163.4m. An annual dividend of EUR1.48 a share was proposed on earnings per share of EUR4.70.

26-08-2010,351,"Diversity is linchpin of BHP 's plan for Potash News analysis ; Spreading its net widely has already bolstered profits , even in a recession , writes William MacNamara and Peter Smith BHP Billiton 's $39bn ( pound(s)25bn ) takeover bid for Canada 's PotashCorp is backed by the mightiest finances in the resources sector , the mining company revealed yesterday as it reported annual profits margins of 38 per cent and operating cash flows that are five times higher than net debt . The world 's biggest mining company assessed the global economy 's prospects more sombrely than usual . But even as its cautious outlook tilted towards bearishness , in its financial results for the year to June 30 it reported that annual pre-tax profits had risen nearly 70 per cent to $19.6bn on the back of higher copper and iron ore prices . The grand design of BHP 's diversification strategy continued to translate from theory to practise , as relative strength in some of its commodities compensated for weakness in others . The workings of this strategy are especially relevant to the market today as BHP proposes to form a large commodity business through its all-cash offer for PotashCorp . Iron ore boosted BHP 's profits more than any other commodity in the year to June , contributing $6bn to earnings before interest and tax out of a group total of $19.7bn. Iron ore 's pre-eminence was similar in 2009 . The second most important profits driver was the base metals division that includes BHP 's copper mines . Buoyant market prices for copper yielded $4.6bn in divisional earnings before interest and tax . This was a sharp rise from the division 's $1.2bn earnings contribution in the year to June 2009 , a period that saw copper prices falter then collapse . The base metals division overtook the metallurgical coal division , which had a strong performance in 2009 but a far weaker one this time . In other words , fluctuations across BHP 's nine commodity divisions roughly balanced out in financial terms over an extremely volatile two years for commodities markets . Revenues were stable , rising only marginally from $50.2bn to $52.8bn. Measured by earnings before interest and tax and excluding one-off items , profits were also relatively stable , rising from $18.2bn to $19.7bn. BHP has now placed $39bn behind the proposition that a new commodity will make the group even stronger . "" We are interested in commodities with different growth profiles , [ whose prices ] kick in at different stages of the economic cycle , "" said Marius Kloppers , chief executive . "" As a shareholder you should only want the most diversified exposure . "" If BHP succeeds in winning control of PotashCorp , it would move the company further away from industrial metals . During the downturn BHP 's profitability was bolstered by its major presence in oil and gas , commodities that no other mining peer produces . Agricultural fertilisers and oil , which are tied to food and energy demand respectively , track different economic cycles to iron ore or copper or aluminium , which track manufacturing demand . BHP 's sometimes-forgotten oil division contributed $4.6bn to group earnings before interest and tax in the year , almost tying with base metals as an earnings contributor . The company 's broad earnings base allowed it to pay down net debt , which fell $2.3bn to $3.3bn. BHP 's net gearing of 6 per cent is now the lowest of its diversified mining peers . Rio Tinto , its nearest rival , reduced its gearing to 20 per cent by June 30 , while Xstrata 's gearing is 19 per cent . Meanwhile , BHP 's cash pile rose from $10.8bn in June 2009 to $12.5bn. The company 's financial position helps explain why its bankers extended a $45bn syndicated loan , the largest corporate loan since December 2008 , for BHP to buy PotashCorp . BHP 's June-end fiscal year masked the benefits it is now receiving from the new system for pricing iron ore , its most valuable commodity . Like Rio , BHP has shifted its Australian iron ore sales from negotiated annual prices to quarterly spot market-based prices , which this week are about $140 a tonne , compared with $60 a tonne - the last benchmark price from the annual system . The transition happened during the first and second quarters of this year , and it made iron ore by far the most profitable commodity for Rio in the six months to June 30 . BHP , the third-biggest iron ore producer in the world after Vale and Rio , only received full exposure to the new system in the last quarter of the year . Analysts expect stronger earnings from BHP 's iron ore for the remainder of the calendar year . Like fellow global miners Rio , Anglo American , and Xstrata , BHP was hit hard by the weakening dollar last year . Its depreciation against the Australian dollar , South African rand and other currencies in operating countries wiped $2.15bn from earnings before interest and tax . BHP upped its final dividend to 45 cents , which takes it total pay-out to 87 cents . Earnings per share were 228.6 cents , up from 105.6 the previous year . Shares in the dual-listed Anglo-Australian miner fell 18.28p to pound(s)17.85 in London .

25-01-2012,353,"Doubts over Barclays Capital help to break banks ' winning streak Barclays was among the sharpest fallers yesterday as London-listed banks ended their longest winning streak since 2005 . The results next month will put pressure on management to restructure its investment banking operations , according to Exane BNP Paribas . A weak fourth quarter for Barclays Capital would "" dominate the 2011 results and raise questions over the group 's medium-term strategy "" , said analyst Tom Rayner . Shifting to higher base salaries and deferred compensation meant BarCap could no longer manage costs through the cycle , Exane argued . It forecast that costs in the quarter will have risen to nearly 90 per cent of net income - well above management 's target of 60-65 per cent . And , while shrinking BarCap could lift the group 's value by a third , management was unlikely to take radical action , Exane said . "" Without greater evidence of cost flexibility within the division , we believe the market will need to hear positive comments about the revenue outlook if earnings downgrades are to be avoided , "" the broker told clients . Barclays ended 1.9 per cent lower at 218 1/2 p , matching a weak trend among banks as the eurozone stalemate triggered profit-taking in a sector that had risen for 10 days . RBS eased 3.9 per cent to 27p and Lloyds Banking Group was 2.8 per cent lower at 31 3/4 p. The FTSE 100 ended down 0.5 per cent , or 30.66 points , at 5,751.90. Ashmore and Hargreaves Lansdown were weakest among the asset managers on downgrades from RBS . "" Regulation is likely to drive structural changes to the European asset management industry , "" RBS said . Enforced deposit gathering by European banks and a UK ban on independent financial advisers charging commissions "" could substantially alter the distribution landscape and demand characteristics of the European market for a long period of time "" . Hargreaves lost 3.4 per cent to 431p and Ashmore fell 2.4 per cent to 355p after RBS moved to "" hold "" and "" sell "" respectively . Pearson , which owns the Financial Times , lost 4.3 per cent to pound(s)11.83 after BarCap moved it to "" underweight "" on valuation grounds . Among the risers , Weir bounced 2.3 per cent to pound(s)19.27. The stock had dropped 14 per cent in a fortnight on fears that US gas prices would hit rig demand . But Goldman Sachs said rig numbers were steady and investors had ignored increased capital expenditure from mining customers , which account for half of Weir 's earnings . It repeated "" buy "" advice with a pound(s)34 target . Chemring lost 13.9 per cent to 386 1/2 p after a cautious outlook from the flak and flare maker led analysts to cut forecasts . House broker JPMorgan Cazenove cut its 2012 earnings forecast by 15 per cent . C&W Worldwide fell 9 per cent to 21 3/4 p , having surged on Monday after a stock overhang cleared . Some investors have speculated about possible takeover interest , although Merrill Lynch was sceptical . "" There is industrial logic for one of the US operators such as AT&T or Verizon buying [ C&W ] , but to date they have never bid for European assets , preferring to build their own networks , "" it said . "" An alternative could be one of the big UK mobile networks who could save money on the backhaul of their networks and cross-sell business services . . . We do n't think investors should get excited as we believe any bidder would be seriously put off by the operational trends . "" Also helped by speculative interest in recent days , Ocado slipped 6.4 per cent to 80 1/4 p. Panmure Gordon , repeating "" sell "" advice , said the online grocer was unlikely to make money before 2013 , so its valuation remained too high to attract predators . Mitchells & Butlers fell 1.8 per cent to 261 1/4 p. Ahead of a shareholder meeting on Thursday , Joe Lewis 's Piedmont vehicle raised its holding in the pubs group to 25.8 per cent . Logica lost 5.1 per cent to 77 1/2 p , with Singer Capital Markets downgrading the IT services group to "" sell "" . A near 100 per cent exposure to Europe gave Logica nowhere to hide from macro-economic conditions and further restructuring might be required , it said . Among small caps , Bowleven dropped 7.2 per cent to 80 1/4 p after Investec cut the Africa-focused oil explorer off its "" buy "" list .

18-07-2013,355,"Earnings worries put pressure on Unilever as miners lift FTSE 100 Earnings worries put Unilever among London 's biggest fallers yesterday . Weaker emerging markets meant Unilever 's sales growth was likely to undershoot market expectations , said Oriel Securities . "" Unilever 's 57 per cent exposure to emerging markets , while strategically desirable for long-term growth , renders the company vulnerable to organic sales growth disappointment , "" said Oriel . Analysts expect the group to deliver 5.5 per cent organic growth when it reports second-quarter results next week , down from 5.7 per cent from the same period last year . However , growth across its markets seems to have slowed by about a percentage point since a year ago and , while Unilever can still outpace peers , the weather-related warning from Coca-Cola this week suggested an extra risk to ice cream sales , Oriel said . Yet Unilever 's valuation has risen to a 10-year high , putting it at a wide premium to peers on earnings ratios , said Credit Suisse . "" There is a lot more to do in both household and food , "" it said . "" The former has delivered better growth , but at a cost to returns . The latter has seen growth slow sharply and market shares come under pressure . More investment is needed .

It argued that poor weather in spring , capacity discipline among European airlines and favourable foreign exchange movements meant pricing was likely to remain strong for the year . Salamander Energy bounced 6.6 per cent to 135.9p , having been weak over the previous two sessions on news of a dry well off the Thailand coast . Goldman Sachs moved its share price target to 363p and argued that , if the rest of Salamander 's 2013 drilling campaign was 100 per cent successful , it could add 430p to that valuation . Essar Energy edged up 2 per cent to 211p after JPMorgan Cazenove highlighted moves by India to deregulate its gas market .

The blue-chip benchmark closed 36.5 points or 0.6 per cent down at 5,935.7. The FTSE 250 index shed 39.4 points or 0.4 per cent at 9,816.1. Volume was a firm 3.8bn shares . But traders took the 100-point fall in the FTSE in two days with relative calm . Many reported that client selling was profit-taking rather than a fundamental change of view . "" For all the selling , nobody really wants to be out of this market , "" said one dealer . Some traders cited uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve 's decision onUS interest rates to explain the fall . Others suggested that even if US rates began to rise , the likely fall in the pound would probably support stocks with a high level of exports , such as drugmakers AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline . Vodafone , the world 's largest mobile network operator , dropped 4 per cent to 119 1/2p after news that the European Commission planned to slash "" excessive "" charges levied on mobile phone users for making and receiving calls when abroad . Analysts at Citigroup estimated that the new laws could cut Vodafone 's Pounds 34bn annual turnover by Pounds 750m-Pounds 1bn . Standard Chartered lost 2.8 per cent to Pounds 14.82 after news that Singapore 's state-owned investment company Temasek had bought the 11.6 per cent stake belonging to long-time shareholder the Khoo family . The future of the stake had been widely discussed since the death in 2004 of the family patriarch Khoo Teck Puat . There had been speculation that another bank such as Barclays or one of the large US banks such as Citigroup or Bank of America could use the shareholding as a base to launch a full bid .

Half of Unilever 's sales come from developing markets that have delivered 9 per cent annual growth on average since 1990 , Merrill said . Yet the shares have sharply underperformed peers , falling 3 per cent since the start of the year amid concerns about a price war in India with Proctor & Gamble . That has opened up a 16 per cent valuation gap against Nestle and Danone based on 2011 earnings , Merrill 's team said .

The broader market struggled for direction on relatively low volumes with the FTSE 100 closing up 7.32 points , or 0.1 per cent , at 5,679.64. The index had been lower for much of the afternoon in response to an unexpected fall in US private sector employment but added 20 points during the closing auction period amid end-of-quarter position squaring . That left the Footsie up 4.9 per cent in the first quarter - its fourth consecutive quarterly gain and its strongest start to the year since 2006 . BSkyB led the blue-chip risers yesterday after a ruling from communications regulator Ofcom on wholesale prices proved much less severe than feared . The broadcaster was up 3.4 per cent to a two-year high of 602p . Analysts judged the news a mild negative for BT Group , off 0.1 per cent to 124p , which had intended to sell Sky Sports HD starting later this year .

London Stock Exchange retreated 1.7 per cent to 710 1/2 p. Credit Suisse reiterated a view that the LSE is "" structurally challenged given its lack of growth businesses and the continued market share erosion in UK cash equities "" . Segro led the Footsie fallers , down 2.8 per cent to 319 1/2 p , as the stock began trading without rights to a 9.4p dividend . Among the mid-caps , Gartmore rallied 7.8 per cent to 125p following its suspension on Tuesday of leading fund manager Guillaume Rambourg . HSBC stuck with "" overweight "" advice . The stock , which has nearly halved in a fortnight as rumours of a problem spread , trades at less than 6 times next year 's earnings which represented "" an excessive "" 50 per cent discount to the UK fund management sector , HSBC said .

31-05-2006,363,"Engelhard agrees to Dollars 5bn BASF acquisition AUTO PARTS MAKER Engelhard , the US manufacturer of catalysts for cars , trucks and factories , has agreed to a takeover by BASF of Germany worth about Dollars 5bn , marking the end of one of the most protracted transatlantic takeover battles . Barry Perry , Engelhard chief executive , said BASF 's latest cash offer of Dollars 39 per share , Dollars 2 higher than the first bid at the start of the year , represented "" fair value "" and recommended shareholders tender their stocks by Monday . Engelhard 's move looks set to seal a transaction that is meant to make BASF less dependent on cyclical earnings in its core chemicals business . It comes some six months after the US group first rejected an unsolicited offer . Jurgen Hambrecht , BASF chief executive , said he was confident of getting at least half of Engelhard stock in the next five days , having made shareholders of the US group a "" last and final "" improved offer last week . The German company had long refused to budge from an initial bid of Dollars 37 per share , arguing the offer was fully priced . It raised it by a dollar when Engelhard unveiled plans to buy back one-fifth of all its stock at Dollars 45 per share and promised investors good profit and sales growth . As the self-imposed tender deadline of June 5 approached , BASF offered another dollar . Both sides were set for a showdown at Engelhard 's annual meeting , scheduled for Friday . That gathering has been postponed indefinitely following the agreed takeover worked out by bankers in recent days . People close to the German side of the deal said it was Mr Perry who contacted Mr Hambrecht a few days ago to propose talks about a deal . Advisers spent the weekend agreeing details of BASF 's largest acquisition . Mr Perry said he and his fellow board members had decided on an agreed deal to end uncertainty about the group 's future . In a statement , the company valued the deal at Dollars 5.6bn , including corporate debt . People close to the deal said Mr Perry would be leaving the company when the takeover was complete . BASF has promised to transfer the headquarters of its existing catalysts unit to Iselin , New Jersey - Engelhard 's base . Restructuring and a strong chemicals cycle has provided BASF with strong profits in recent months . BASF has already used part of a big cash pile to buy the construction chemicals unit of Degussa , a German rival , for about Euros 3bn . Mr Hambrecht has likened the Engelhard deal to the purchase of Wintershall , a gas supplier , more than 30 years ago , when BASF used bumper profits to reduce exposure to chemicals . The unit is its most profitable . Lehman Brothers advised BASF and Merrill Lynch advised Engelhard .",engelhard agrees to dollars 5bn basf acquisition auto parts maker
13-02-2013,365,"Evangelism belies change at Barclays News analysis ; Investors appear supportive of the bank 's strategic review , write FT reporters Antony Jenkins was in his element yesterday . After a tone-setting spot of sepulchral organ music , the newish chief executive of Barclays took to the stage of London 's Royal Horticultural Hall at 10.30am to tell the assembled media about the strategic review he had begun when he won the top job six months ago . Mr Jenkins - pristine in shiny buckled shoes and Barclays cyan-blue tie - delivered a well-trailed message of the bank 's new ethical standards . There was a responsible new tax code and a sermon to peers on society 's changed attitudes to banking . In one way it was all very British - relatively low key , and in tune with the political feedback the bank has been showered with ever since Mr Jenkins ' American predecessor , Bob Diamond , was ejected last year following the bank 's pound(s)290m Libor rate-manipulation fine from regulators . But there was a hint of American evangelism about the message , too . The hall - deliberately chosen as a real-world location away from Barclays ' Canary Wharf headquarters - was branded with slick buzzwords to hammer home Mr Jenkins ' belief in "" respect "" , "" integrity "" , "" service "" , "" excellence "" and "" stewardship "" , spelling out one of the chief executive 's signature acronyms . However , there was a fair amount of substance , too - in particular , a detailed analysis of the bank split into 75 business lines which were then judged against a range of performance and reputational criteria . The conclusion - that 39 businesses are fine , 15 need to be tweaked , 17 need serious attention to avoid closure or sale , and four are definitely for the axe - will have important consequences . The most closely watched area for overhaul is Barclays ' investment banking business . Aside from the planned closure of the bank 's controversial tax structuring business , the pullback from agricultural commodities and two legacy fixed income units , two other unspecified proprietary trading operations will be stopped . Otherwise , the changes in the investment banking division are modest . Barclays ' Asian equities business will be trimmed to focus on non-Asian clients , driving the bulk of the division 's 1,800 job cuts . Analysts said Barclays ' good market position in investment banking in general and debt trading in particular had stopped management from wielding a stronger axe in this publicly disliked business unit . "" Barclays is not a UBS where you can just scale fixed income down , "" says Kian Abouhossein , analyst at JPMorgan . "" You ca n't reduce RWAs [ risk-weighted assets ] materially in a business that makes most of your profits . "" The group 's results seemed to vindicate Mr Jenkins ' decision to chop slightly more jobs in the retail banking side than in investment banking . In the past year , the investment bank was the main profit machine , accounting for 58 per cent of overall pre-tax earnings . And in the fourth quarter , the unit outshone most rivals . In the advisory businesses revenues where up 29 per cent sequentially compared with an average increase at European and US peers of 18 per cent . In bond trading , the investment bank 's engine , Barclays ' revenues dropped 8 per cent compared with the third quarter , while its largest global rivals on average lost 26 per cent . With fixed income revenues of pound(s)1.46bn in the fourth quarter , the bank has now overtaken Deutsche Bank , one of its main rivals . Even in equities where Mr Jenkins is paring back the franchise , Barclays ' 9 per cent revenue fall was less severe than that of most rivals . The strategic review also involves significant retrenchment from consumer banking , with 30 per cent of branches in continental Europe - mostly Italy and Spain - to be closed with the loss of 1,900 jobs . There will be little change in the bank 's UK retail and Barclaycard divisions , and none of the proposals for these units highlighted in the review will mark a radical break with the past . Investment products for retail banking customers will be sold online without accompanying advice , instead of through an independent financial adviser , although this process is already substantially under way and reflects a shift throughout the industry as a whole . Another measure mentioned indirectly in the strategic plan referred to the ongoing rundown of a secured loans business , FirstPlus , which was closed to new customers in 2008 . Between them the changes should allow Mr Jenkins to deliver a return on equity above the bank 's 11.5 per cent cost of capital by 2015 and underpin a more generous payout ratio to shareholders of 30 per cent versus the previous 20-25 per cent target . Now all he has to do is follow through on the promises . Judging by the 8.6 per cent jump in the share price yesterday , Mr Jenkins may already be preaching to the converted .

16-06-2010,367,"Falling food inflation takes a bite out of Tesco sales growth Tesco 's underlying sales growth in the UK has dropped to its lowest levels in at least six years as falling food inflation hits the biggest grocer in the country . The world 's third-biggest grocer yesterday reported underlying sales rose just 0.1 per cent , excluding fuel , in the first quarter . This is the weakest growth recorded by Tesco since it started breaking out forecourt sales from the underlying grocery take in early 2004 . Some analysts estimated the underlying grocery sales performance might have been the weakest by the retailer in more than a decade . "" I ca n't remember flat like-for-likes , "" said Clive Black , an analyst at Shore Capital who has covered Tesco for more than 15 years . "" Although we are bulls [ on Tesco ] , we do n't rewrite facts and 0.1 per cent is a very subdued performance . But it is not out of kilter within the market ; I would be more worried if it was . "" David McCarthy , an analyst at Evolution Securities , added the first quarter was the weakest performance he could remember since he started covering the company about two decades ago . The whole of the industry has been hit on two counts this year . Food inflation , which flatters grocers since it increases their take at the tills , has fallen sharply , while sales volumes are also more muted as people cut back on food shopping to pay for more expensive petrol . Laurie McIlwee , Tesco 's finance director , said food inflation , which had been reaching 9 per cent or more a year ago , was now flat . But he voiced confidence that trading would pick up in the coming months . "" If anything , trading outlook gets better because of inflation lapping [ on last year ] in the next three to four weeks . A lot depends on how the [ government 's ] emergency Budget goes next week but , all other things being equal , our target should be to exit the year at 3-4 per cent [ underlying sales growth ] , "" he said . "" The outlook is more positive . "" The sluggish performance comes at a critical time for Tesco . The retailer is poised to embark on its most radical management shake-up in more than a decade after the announcement last week that Sir Terry Leahy would retire as chief executive in March 2011 after 14 years at the helm . He is to be replaced by Philip Clarke , currently Tesco 's international and IT director .

But Expro International bucked the trend , dropping 3.2 per cent to 505p . Vodafone , mobile network operator , was down 1.8 per cent to 151 1/ 2p after an investor day left the market disappointed . There had been speculation that Vodafone would announce a return of cash to shareholders , as it did at a similar event a year ago . But chief executive Arun Sarin said he would not comment on the issue until interim results in November , leaving investors - who had been hoping for the same sort of rally that saw Vodafone rise 12 per cent in two months a year ago - disappointed . Vodafone 's US partner , Verizon Wireless , warned that Hurricane Katrina had cost up to Dollars 48m in damage repairs . Exel added 0.4 per cent to Pounds 12.33 after Deutsche Post confirmed its offer of Pounds 3.7bn for the transport group . There was heavy trading in Hays , recruitment consultancy , as it started life in the mid-cap indices following its demotion in the latest FTSE quarterly reshuffle .

MFI has been immune from the recent retailer sell-off , buoyed by takeover speculation and the belief that the management might be changed and its Howden and MFI businesses demerged .

The stocks fell following a scathing note from Nomura analyst Mike Prew , who argued that real estate investment trusts had taken advantage of tax breaks without changing their debt levels to match . Reits lose a tax shield on interest payments , making borrowing more expensive . In spite of this , the sector remained "" leveraged for sustained asset inflation "" and was generating very thin retained profits as a result , Mr Prew said . "" To relay portfolio returns directly to shareholders , Reits need to delever , "" he told clients . "" After all , managements have read the cycle poorly and investors need to be compensated for the mounting risk of a ' post QE [ quantitative easing ] relapse ' in property values . "" Nomura had "" reduce "" ratings on British Land , down 2.3 per cent to 463p , and Liberty International , off 1.2 per cent to 482 1/2 p. The wider market rallied in tandem with Wall Street and the FTSE 100 bounced off a 1.2 per cent loss to close down just 0.1 per cent . The index , which on Friday reached its highest level since June 2008 , ended 5.58 points lower at 5,644.54. Energy stocks were the weakest as a rising dollar pushed oil to a three-week low and Friday 's unexpected Indian interest rate rise provided a catalyst to take profit . BG Group , last week the subject of vague bid hopes , fell 1.8 per cent to pound(s)11.80 1/2 and Cairn Energy was down 1.4 per cent to 378 3/4 p. Wolseley lost 2.1 per cent to pound(s)15.86 after Ian Meakins , its new chief executive , set out a restructuring plan that was more conservative and longer term than some investors had hoped . Having hit a nine-year high last week , Autonomy was down 1.3 per cent to pound(s)18.13 after UBS cut the software maker off its "" buy "" list on valuation grounds . UBS also noted that , while management had targeted a big acquisition for the autumn , the deal could come earlier . J Sainsbury was 1.2 per cent off at 329 1/4 after ING analysts said the group 's trading update , due tomorrow , might disappoint .

Merrill Lynch restarted coverage of Smiths with a "" buy "" rating and pound(s)13 target , citing cost-cutting potential at its medical and mechanical seals businesses .

"" The probability of the deal going ahead between BHP and Potash seems to be decreasing , "" said Citigroup , which added that a collapse "" would be a positive for the BHP share price in the short term "" . With the sharp rise in fertiliser prices , Potash shares had underperformed peers since June , in spite of BHP 's bid in August , Citi noted . It also highlighted uncertainties about how the Saskatchewan government might tax BHP . The province had estimated it could lose $2bn-$3bn from the takeover , and could raise royalties or impose an asset transfer tax if it finds BHP 's offer of $370m compensation insufficient , Citi added . Investment Canada is expected to give its findings on the bid next Wednesday and could block BHP on grounds of national interest . Failure of the bid would probably result in BHP returning about $20bn to shareholders , analysts said . The wider market rallied after two days of declines . The FTSE 100 rose 31.87 points , or 0.6 per cent , to 5,677.89. Vodafone was up 2.7 per cent to 170 3/4 p after France Telecom pointed to improvement in Europe and amid continued speculation that the UK group might be nearing a deal with US joint venture partner Verizon .

Schroders took on 4.6 per cent to pound(s)15.95 and Aberdeen Asset Management added 0.9 per cent to 177p on the back of "" overweight "" recommendations from Morgan Stanley . Recent takeovers had valued asset managers at about 11-12 times operating earnings , which made Schroders and Aberdeen look cheap at about eight times , Morgan Stanley said . Among the banks , Standard Chartered was up 2.8 per cent to pound(s)18.25 amid a retread of talk that JPMorgan might be interested in bidding . But traders cautioned that noise levels had increased since nil-paid rights to StanChart 's pound(s)3.3bn equity issue started trading on Wednesday .

Its shares improved 0.5 per cent to 738 1/2p after Cazenove , house broker , highlighted the earnings potential of Barclays ' strategic agreement with China Development Bank . On Monday , CDB said it would take a Euros 2.2bn stake in Barclays and invest a further Euros 7.6bn if the UK bank 's bid for ABN Amro , a Dutch rival , was successful . At a presentation , Barclays told Cazenove that it expected meaningful revenues from the agreement in 2008 , mainly through commodity products . It pointed out that CDB was the vehicle through which the Chinese government would develop a commodities hedging market . "" Based on our 2010 forecasts , we estimate a Pounds 500m incremental pre-tax profit opportunity for Barclays or Pounds 800m for the combined group ( which includes ABN ) , "" Cazenove said Traders pointed out that , if Barclays shares reach 798p , its offer would achieve parity with the rival bid for ABN Amro . In the wider market , leading shares fell sharply , unsettled by poor results from the US . In particular , a profit warning from Countrywide , the biggest mortgage lender in the US , really hit sentiment . The FTSE 100 closed down 125.7 points , or 1.9 per cent , at 6,498.7 while the FTSE 250 dropped 198.2 points , or 1.7 per cent , to 11,584 .

Its shares firmed up 0.7 per cent to 613 1/2p on talk that the hedge fund manager could be a takeover target for UBS , or another large investment bank , now that it has demerged its brokerage division . Imperial Tobacco added 0.8 per cent to Pounds 23.13 as investors looked to defensive stocks . Imperial benefited from speculation that the company would look to sell Logista , the logistics business that it will inherit if its Euros 12.6bn acquisition of Spanish rival Altadis goes ahead . Citigroup , which lifted its target price on Imperial to Pounds 25.50 yesterday , said selling the business could generate Pounds 1.9bn and would leave Imperial requiring a Pounds 3bn rights issue to finance the Altadis deal . Yell Group rose 0.7 per cent to 472 1/2p on relief that first- quarter results had met expectations . On the downside , Royal Bank of Scotland was marked 2.1 per cent lower at 602 1/2p because of the warning from Countrywide . Traders pointed out that Countrywide had blamed some of its woes on weakness in the prime mortgage market and that RBS had Dollars 53bn of exposure to mortgages and home equity in the US . They also said there was negative read-across for HSBC , off 1.6 per cent at 887p . Centrica faded 1.2 per cent to 375 1/4p in spite of Credit Suisse telling clients that earnings upgrades were likely to follow next week 's half-year results . Sports Direct International , the sports wear re-tailer , provided the main talking point in the FTSE 250 as its shares slumped 22.6 per cent to 147p after maiden results disappointed and the company warned on profit for 2008 . Sports Direct floated at 300p in February . After the market closed , the company said it had bought back 3.8m shares at 148p . FKI , the engineer , rallied 2.7 per cent to 113 1/4p on relief that takeover talks with an unnamed bidder were still on and trading remained in line with expectations . Britvic , the soft drinks company that makes Robinsons fruit squash , improved 3.8 per cent to 354p after Deutsche Bank upgraded it to "" buy "" .

4-08-2010,377,"Fresnillo poised to overtake BHP in silver output MINING Fresnillo said it was poised to overtake BHP Billiton and become the world 's largest silver producer by the end of next year after it announced bumper profits in its half-year results yesterday . Pre-tax profits for the Mexico-based miner rose to $354.4m , up from $179.9m on the same period last year , on the back of high gold and silver prices and increased production . That was underpinned by sales of $605.6m , buoyed by the average price of gold and silver , which has risen by more than a quarter because of investor fears of sovereign debt risk . The company said it would pay a dividend of 9.2 cents per share . Much of that will be accrued by Alberto Bailleres , the Mexican billionaire who is a majority shareholder in Penoles mining group , which owns 77 per cent of Fresnillo . At present , Fresnillo is the largest primary producer of silver but third behind BHP and Poland 's KGHM Polska Miedz - which produces silver as a by-product of other metals - according to a 2010 survey by GFMS , a precious metals consultancy . Jaime Lomelin , Fresnillo chief executive , says that the opening of the Saucito mine in central Mexico next year will eventually add 9m extra ounces to overall production . "" Saucito is opening in the first semester of next year with a capacity of 4.5m [ rising ] to 9m ounces . By the end of 2011 , we will be producing 43m ounces of primary silver and we will become the largest producer of silver overall . "" Fresnillo said profits were aided by record output at the northern Herradura gold mine , which helped pushed overall production up to 176,351 ounces , up 32.7 per cent . In the short term , analysts say the price of gold will remain stable relative to silver , which is used in everything from solar energy panels to plasma computer screens . If global economic activity falters , silver is more likely to be held hostage to investor demand for "" haven "" assets . "" [ Fresnillo ] are cautious about nearer-term economic recovery and industrial demand for silver , which accounts for about 47 per cent of total demand . "" If that falters it can only be made up by higher demand from the investment side , "" said Charles Cooper , a mining analyst at Oriel Securities . Fresnillo 's diluted earnings per share were 30 cents , up from 16.9 cents . Its shares closed up 12 pence to pound(s)10.70 in London .

05-05-2005,379,"Buoyant BAT draws the benefit from IFRS TOBACCO :  New accounting rules helped British American Tobacco report a rise in first-quarter profit yesterday , despite a fall in sales , which briefly nudged the shares past the Pounds 10 mark .  The group 's first set of results under the new International Financial Reporting Standards were also boosted by strong performances in Russia and Africa , which offset declines in Canada , Japan and Malaysia .  Underlying earnings per share exceeded many forecasts , rising by 26 per cent compared with estimated rises of about 10 per cent .  The group , which makes Kent , Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes , was helped by cost reductions , a lower tax rate and the share buy-back programme .  BAT also benefited from changes in its distribution agreements in Italy and the Reynolds American transaction , which last year saw BAT merge its US operations with those of RJ Reynolds .  But Jan du Plessis , chairman , cautioned that comparisons would become more difficult as the year progressed and that the current earnings growth was not indicative of the rest of year .  Analysts predicted that growth would be closer to 10 to 12 per cent .  The rise was , however , enough to enable BAT 's shares to breach the Pounds 10 mark for the first time .  They later closed 21 1/2p higher at 995 1/2p .  During the quarter , organic volume growth rose by 0.6 per cent , reversing the trend of volume decline from others in the sector .  But Paul Adams , chief executive , said he was expecting better growth for the year as whole .  "" I would be very disappointed if it was n't 1 to 1.5 per cent , "" he said .  Most of BAT 's geographic regions reported higher profits , with the exception of America Pacific , where profits fell Pounds 35m to Pounds 88m as the Canadian market continued to feel the effects of higher duty that has prompted smokers to turn away from premium brands to value cigarettes .  In Japan , increased competition from Japan Tobacco was behind volume and profit falls .  The separation out of Reynolds American , which is now counted as an associate , also dented profits and volumes .  The results for the quarter were complicated by IFRS , which caused pre-tax profit to rise from Pounds 575m to Pounds 624m in the three months to March 31 , as post-tax profit from BAT 's associates were added back into the results .  Operating profit fell from Pounds 604m to Pounds 582m , and were hit by the sale of Etinera , the distribution group , and the new treatment of BAT 's 42 per cent stake in Reynolds American .  Turnover fell from Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 2.1bn , and earnings per share were 22 per cent higher at 20.26p ( 16.65p ) .",FT other BAT
26-05-2005,381,"BAT tests the market for snus  British American Tobacco is to test market snus , a form of smokeless tobacco , in Sweden and South Africa using two of its biggest brands .  Snus are small tobacco filled sachets , resembling miniature teabags , that are placed under the lip .  Similar products are popular in Sweden , with almost 20 per cent of adults using them regularly .  Some believe that they are behind Sweden 's low adult lung cancer rates .  The products are virtually unknown in South Africa , but BAT has a 90 per cent share of the market , making the country an ideal test base .  BAT will be selling snus in both countries under its Lucky Strike and Peter Stuyvesant brands .  Chris Proctor , head of science and regulation at BAT , said that the launch had been in response to the group listening to the concerns of public health officials about cigarettes .  The snus will be sold in 241 outlets in Johannesburg , and 300 in Stockholm .  If the product proves successful after a year 's trial BAT intends rolling it out to more cities and countries .  But any expansion would have to be outside of the EU , where snus are banned , except for in Sweden .  Mr Proctor said that while he believed that the EU 's decision to ban snus was wrong , the group had no intention of arguing for a relaxation or overturning of the ruling at this point .  However , any repeal of the ban would leave BAT ahead of the market , given the absence of other big name brands in the market .  Deborah Arnott , director of Action on Smoking and Health in the UK , conceded that smokeless tobacco products were less harmful than combustible products .  But she accused tobacco companies of using reduced harm products as a way for them to "" find a way back in from the cold "" .",FT other BAT
02-05-2012,383,"BHP shifts spending strategy  BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest mining company by market value , has moved to soothe shareholder nerves about its ambitious investment programme by saying it will match capital expenditure closely with cash flows and stagger its pipeline of large projects .  In a series of meeting with analysts and investors , Alberto Calderon , chief executive of aluminium , nickel and corporate development at BHP , has flagged how revised cash flow forecasts will affect the company 's investments plans , according to people who attended the briefings .  "" The key message was that BHP will be staggering capex to match cash flow , and with expectations of cash flow having being lowered over the past 12 months due to concerns over Europe ... there is less cash available to be spent on projects , "" said Citigroup analyst Clarke Wilkins .  However , BHP is unlikely to bow to shareholder pressure for a share buyback .  "" Even though capex is likely to be lower , enough projects appear to be able to meet hurdle rates to consume cash flow generated , meaning buybacks would not appear imminent , "" said Mr Wilkins .  BHP has three large projects with an estimated capital cost in excess of $ 50bn due to be submitted for board approval by the end of the company 's financial year in June 2012 .  They are the expansion of BHP 's Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in South Australia , the Port Hedland Outer Harbour project in Western Australia and the Jansen potash development in Canada .  Speculation had been mounting that at least one of those investments would be delayed .  The company has been criticised by some shareholders for looking to push ahead with all three , given the uncertain global economic outlook , slowing growth in China and rising costs .  Analysts said BHP is likely to proceed with the $ 20bn Outer Harbour iron ore project that involves the construction of a 4 km jetty and the dredging of a 30 km channel out into the Indian Ocean , and stagger development of the other the projects .  "" We believe the chances of all three projects receiving investment sanction over the next 12 to 18 months are very low , "" said Lee Bowers , analyst at Macquarie Securities .  Unlike Outer Habour , Olympic Dam and Jansen , which are targeting energy and food markets , are considered late-cycle economic projects that can be pushed back without too much impact on returns .  In addition , the economics of the Olympic Dam project could become less favourable if Wayne Swan , the Australian treasurer , removes a diesel fuel rebate and the ability to offset the cost of removing overburden , or waste material , from a mine against tax .  Mr Swan has vowed to return the budget to a surplus by 2012/13 .  "" BHP thinks there 's a window of opportunity in the iron ore market before demand starts heading south in 2025 ... and they can make good money from the [ Pilbara ] in that time , ' said Glyn Lawcock , the Sydney-based head of resource research at UBS .  Mr Lawcock believes Marius Kloppers , BHP 's chief executive , could use a speech he is due to make at a conference in Miami later this month to provide more detail on the company 's strategy .  Shares in BHP were 0.4 per cent higher at A$36.10 in Sydney trading on Wednesday afternoon .",FT other BHP
16-05-2005,385,"BHP Billiton drops Posco joint venture in east India IRON AND STEEL :  BHP Billiton has pulled out of a Dollars 10bn iron ore and steel joint venture with South Korea 's Posco in eastern India - the country 's largest foreign direct investment - after refusing to accept financial conditions laid out by the local government .  The move by the Australian group is a setback to the project , which had already been unsettled by disagreements over mining and export rights , and will add to concerns of global mining companies over investment in India .  Mittal Steel , the world 's biggest steel manufacturer , and Arcelor have expressed an interest in investing in mineral-rich east India , notably the state of Orissa .  Posco said it would proceed alone , making up the Dollars 1.2bn shortfall from its mining partner 's withdrawal , and it hoped to sign a much-delayed memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government "" soon "" .  A senior executive at BHP Billiton in India said the company was "" disappointed "" at having to pull out of the project , which is due to start producing steel in July 2009 with capacity rising from 2m tonnes a year to 12m tonnes by 2013 .  He added the decision to pull out followed Orissa 's insistence on contractual conditions that made "" the opportunity ( for us ) too small "" .  Orissa 's government said it would allocate iron ore and captive mining rights only to equity partners in the project 's steel mill .  BHP Billiton had earlier chosen not to hold equity , and told the government of its decision a month ago .  Under the original joint- venture terms , BHP would have constructed an iron-ore stockyard , a port , and railway to ferry and export the minerals , and a coking plant .  BHP officials say discussions might resume with Posco on a possible role outside the joint venture to supply iron ore or build infrastructure .  But the chances of participating in the 12m-tonne capacity steel project look slim , leaving BHP Billiton with little to show from a strategy designed to gain a strong foothold in Orissa , home to the bulk of India 's high-grade iron-ore reserves .  Ho Chan Ryu , Posco 's senior representative in Orissa , said the company "" would like to resume its partnership in India with BHP Billiton "" .  But "" without more favourable terms ( on the export of iron ore BHP ) may not be interested to come back merely as a contractor "" .",FT other BHP
16-05-2012,387,"BHP scales back expansion programme  Jac Nasser , chairman of BHP Billiton , said the global mining group had cut back its ambitious $ 80bn expansion programme and warned of a further easing of commodity prices .  At a business lunch in Sydney on Wednesday , in which he was openly critical of Australia 's ruling Labor party , Mr Nasser said the "" environment "" had changed since the plan was first announced by Marius Kloppers , BHP 's chief executive , in February 2011 .  "" It 's all about the appropriate allocation of capital .   When Marius talked about the $ 80bn , the environment was different , "" he said .  Asked if that meant BHP would still spend $ 80bn on expansion projects by the end of the 2015 financial year he said : "" No "" .  His comments are the strongest hint yet that BHP is preparing to delay projects because of a weaker outlook for commodity prices as Chinese economic growth slows , and escalating costs in the mining industry .  "" The tailwind of high commodity prices has contributed to record growth in the sector .  Now we have a period where those tailwinds are moderating and we expect further easing over time , "" said Mr Nasser .  "" Where the industry previously lacked investment opportunities and choice , it now has more projects than cash flows .  All of us in the industry are having to make choices . ""  Earlier this month , Alberto Calderón , BHP 's head of aluminium , nickel and corporate development , said the miner would stagger its expenditure to match its cash flows , potentially slowing the development of three so-called mega projects .  The projects would be approved and managed in a way that "" maximises value , reduces risk and balances short- and long-term returns , "" Mr Calderón said .  Analysts believe BHP will press ahead with expansion of its iron ore mines in South Australia , which could cost as must as $ 22bn , because the company senses an opportunity to serve China 's need for steelmaking materials , while demand remains strong .  However , projects such as the expansion of the Olympic Dam copper-uranium mine in Western Australia or the Jansen potash project in Canada could be slowed and developed in phases , according to analysts .  In his speech to the Australian Institute of Company Directors , Mr Nasser criticised the ruling Labor government for tinkering with the tax regime .  "" It is the right of governments to set the tax regime but I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia 's tax system is generating negative investor reaction .  People do n't know where it 's going , "" he said .  Shares in BHP fell to 4 per cent to a near three-year low of A$32.49 on Wednesday in a weak Australian stock market .",FT other BHP
27-05-2005,389,"BHP sets deadline for WMC bid NEWS DIGEST  BHP Billiton yesterday ratcheted up the pressure on WMC shareholders to accept its ADollars 9.2bn ( Dollars 7bn ) agreed offer for the Australian mining group , saying its bid would close on June 3 .  The move led to heavy selling in WMC shares , causing them to fall below the offer price for the first time since the bid was launched in March .  The shares had been bought up in recent weeks by hedge funds hoping for a higher offer either from BHP or for a rival bid from Rio Tinto , as has been persistently rumoured .  "" WMC shareholders now need to make a decision , "" said Chip Goodyear , BHP 's chief executive .  "" It is not in the interests of BHP Billiton or WMC shareholders to further extend the offer . ""  The Melbourne-based group also said its bid for WMC , one of the world 's biggest nickel and copper miners , would become unconditional if it secured 50 per cent by June 3 , a move that , under Australian regulations , would automatically lead to an extension of the offer for a further two weeks .  Although the Anglo-Australian group , the world 's biggest diversified mining house , won a recommendation for its bid from the WMC board , as of yesterday morning it had secured just 4.5 per cent , on top of the 4.3 per cent exposure it already held through derivatives .  WMC also urged shareholders to accept the offer , which topped a rival bid from Xstrata , the Swiss group , by ADollars 1bn .  "" In the 11 weeks since the receipt of BHP Billiton 's offer , your board has not had any other approaches , "" it said .  Since the bid was unveiled , falling commodity prices and concerns about slowing Chinese growth have caused a sharp drop in the share prices of many resources groups , increasing the offer 's attractiveness .  Even before the recent corrections , many analysts felt BHP was paying a full price for WMC , whose shares were trading at just over ADollars 5 before it was put in play last October by an approach from Xstrata .

31-05-2012,391,"BHP wins approval for $ 20bn ' mega-project '  BHP Billiton has received the final environmental approval for its $ 20bn iron ore project in Western Australia , as the world 's biggest mining groups come under pressure from shareholders to take a more cautious approach to investment .  The London-listed miner said on Thursday that Australia 's federal government had approved the project , which involves the expansion of the Outer Harbour at Port Hedland , enabling BHP to expand its exports of iron ore to about 350m tonnes a year by 2022 .  The entire project , including work at the mine itself , could cost in excess of $ 20bn , according to analysts at Deutsche Bank .  The Outer Harbour development - one of BHP 's "" mega-projects "" that will total as much as $ 100bn in capital expenditure over the next 15 years - is likely to be considered by the miner 's board later this year .  Jac Nasser , BHP 's chairman , this month said that the mining industry now has "" more projects than cash flows .  All of us in the industry are having to make choices "" .  His comments echoed those of Alberto Calderón , chief executive of aluminium , nickel and corporate development at BHP , who has said that the miner 's capital spending would be approved and managed in a way that "" maximises value , reduces risk and balances short and long-term returns "" .  Analysts expect BHP to press ahead with the Outer Harbour expansion , which requires the construction of a 4 km jetty and the dredging of a 30 km channel into the ocean .  BHP sees Chinese demand for iron ore remaining strong until 2024 , offering an opportunity to feed the nation 's appetite for steelmaking materials .  Last year the miner produced about 144m tonnes of iron ore from its operations in Western Australia .  Other projects - such as the Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine and the development of Jansen , a potash project in Canada - are more likely to be phased out or delayed , argue analysts .

03-05-2012,397,"BP succeeds in delaying damages trial   BP has succeeded in its attempt to delay a trial over damages arising from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , overcoming objections from the US federal government and gulf coast states that had wanted a trial to start by the summer .  The judge in New Orleans who has been hearing the case held a private conference on Thursday morning with lawyers for all sides involved , and in the afternoon announced a new trial date of January 14 2013 .  The trial , which will address civil actions from private sector plaintiffs and the US authorities , but not any criminal charges , had originally been scheduled to begin in February .  It was delayed after BP and lawyers representing individuals and businesses affected by the spill agreed a settlement of their legal action , worth an estimated $ 7.8bn , which was granted preliminary approval on Wednesday .  BP is still facing action from US federal , state and local governments , while other companies involved including Transocean and Halliburton are facing claims from the authorities and the private sector .  The US government and the state of Alabama had argued that a trial of those cases should begin by the summer , because damages payments from BP were needed quickly to restore the gulf coastline .  However , BP had argued that a trial could not begin until a final resolution of its settlement with the private sector plaintiffs , which will come after a hearing scheduled for November 8 .  By January 14 , it is possible the US Department of Justice , the federal authority running the case against BP , could be in transition to a new administration .  If Mitt Romney , set to be the Republican candidate in November 's election , wins the presidency , he will take over on January 20 .  DoJ officials say enforcement actions are always separated from political influence .  However , the attorney-general , who leads the DoJ , is a political appointment , and analysts have speculated that a different attorney-general could take a different view of the case .  Eric Holder , the present attorney-general , said on Wednesday that more criminal charges were likely in connection with the disaster , after charges of obstruction of justice were filed last month against a former BP engineer .  Kurt Mix , who has been accused of deleting from his mobile phone text messages relating to the rate at which oil was flowing from the well , pleaded not guilty to the charges at a separate court hearing in New Orleans on Thursday .  BP and the plaintiffs ' lawyers are launching an advertising campaign to tell people how to claim for a share of their settlement .  Lawyers for the two sides will begin placing adverts in about 2,100 national and local newspapers , as well as magazines , websites and television and radio stations , telling people how to file a claim .  There will also be mailshots to potential claimants who can be identified from legal records and the Gulf Coast Claims Facility , the BP-backed compensation fund that has been wound up to be replaced by lawyers administering the settlement .  The two sides estimate that 83 per cent of the US adults will see the adverts an average of 3.8 times , while 95 per cent of the residents of the gulf coast region will see them an average of 8.8 times .  In a joint court filing last month , BP and the plaintiffs ' lawyers said the campaign "" may come to be regarded as one of the most comprehensive and elaborate "" notice programmes in litigation history .  The wording is agreed by both sides and approved by the court .  BP is picking up the bill but has not disclosed how much the campaign will cost .  Anyone who wants to share in the settlement must file a claim by the deadline , and give up all rights to sue BP over any of the issues covered by the settlement .  Until the final number of claims is known , the cost of the settlement to BP remains uncertain .  BP has estimated it at $ 7.8bn , an amount that it will be able to meet within the $ 37.2bn that it has set aside for spill costs , but the eventual outcome could be higher or lower .  Although about 100,000 plaintiffs had active claims against BP when the settlement was agreed in March , tens of thousands more could come forward with claims for financial loss and health effects .",FT other BP
23-05-2012,399,"BP to invest $ 400m to end pollution case  BP has agreed to invest $ 400m in air pollution reduction equipment at its Whiting refinery in Indiana in a precedent-setting legal case brought by the US government and environmental groups .  The US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice had been threatening to take away permits needed for BP 's multibillion-dollar modernisation of the refinery because of alleged violations of the Clean Air Act during construction and operation at the refinery .  The agreement is expected to set a standard for pollution control throughout the US refining industry .  Under the settlement announced on Wednesday afternoon , BP will spend $ 400m on projects to cut air pollution from Whiting , which is less than 20 miles south of central Chicago .  The new equipment includes more compressors to cut the waste gas that is sent for flaring , improved flare stacks that will burn off pollutants more efficiently and monitors to check for refinery emissions in local communities .  In some cases , that equipment will be more advanced than the pollution controls required in other US refineries , environmental campaigners said .  The investment is expected to cut the refinery 's annual emissions of pollutants such as benzene and sulphur dioxide by about 4,000 tonnes , reducing local health problems such as asthma .  BP also agreed to pay $ 8m in fines for alleged pollution limit violations going back to 2001 .  The case brought by the US authorities followed action from environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club , which had challenged air pollution permits issued to BP in 2008 for the modernisation of Whiting .  The government argued that BP had breached a 2001 agreement over pollution controls at all its US refineries .  "" BP North America has not lived up to all of its obligations under an earlier settlement agreement and has committed new violations of the Clean Air Act , "" said Ignacia Moreno , US assistant attorney-general .  "" This settlement secures a significant penalty , requires state-of-the-art controls , and is a fair and just resolution . ""  Steve Cornell , president of BP Products North America , said the company was "" pleased to have reached an agreement that protects jobs , consumers , and the environment "" .  He added : "" This multibillion-dollar modernisation project is the largest private-sector investment in Indiana history and ensures the Whiting refinery will continue to provide fuel and jobs for the region for decades to come . ""  Whiting plays a central role in BP 's US refining strategy .  The company is restructuring its American refining business , and plans to sell its refineries at Texas City , its largest , and Carson , California by the end of the year .  The Whiting refinery will be BP 's largest once Texas City is sold , and the modernisation project - estimated to cost $ 3.8bn in the most recent published figure - will enable it to process oil from the Canadian tar sands , which are expected to make an increasingly important contribution to US fuel supplies but have been strongly attacked by environmentalists .  The refinery will still be able to use tar sands oil , but Ann Alexander of the NRDC said the settlement would "" ensure local communities in north-west Indiana and Chicago 's south side will be protected from the worst air pollution impacts "" .  Eric Schaeffer of the Environmental Integrity Project , which works to fight pollution , said the Whiting agreement would be a model for how refineries could cut their emissions .  "" When a refinery needs a permit , "" he said , "" the EPA can say : ' The permit will require you to use the best technology available and will require you to do what BP has done ' . ""  BP has also been in talks with the US government over a possible deal to resolve actions resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster .  A trial of the civil case arising from that disaster , including penalties and damages sought by the US federal , state and local governments , has been set for January 14 next year .  ",FT other BP
30-05-2012,401,"BP battles against perception of drift  News analysis  Sustained fallout from the Deepwater Horizon spill and its Russian venture is damaging faith in the UK oil major 's vision for the future , writes Guy Chazan   With the sudden departure of its chief executive on Monday , TNK-BP , BP 's Russia joint venture , is heading towards an uncertain future .  The same could be said for BP .  The UK oil major is in limbo .  It is facing tortuous litigation over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill and is still smarting from the collapse of its big strategic tie-up with Russia 's state oil company Rosneft last year .  The latest turmoil at TNK-BP only deepens the sense of drift .  "" BP has major issues outstanding that are constraining its options and preventing it moving forward , "" says Ivor Pether , a senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management , which owns £ 315m in the oil group 's stock .  Others are more forthright .  "" What is their strategy exactly ? "" says one top-10 investor .  "" We need some clear guidance as to what kind of energy company they want to be .  And they need to make sure it 's not just more of the same . ""  The latest setback came on Monday when Mikhail Fridman , the Russian billionaire and one of BP 's partners in TNK-BP , quit as chief executive - the climax of a governance crisis at the Russian oil producer .  The tensions have evoked memories of the bitter shareholder battle of 2008 that ended with Bob Dudley , TNK-BP 's chief executive at the time , being forced to quit Russia .  Tensions are showing no signs of easing soon .  The company 's board has not met since December , when two independent directors quit , and there is little likelihood that BP will receive a dividend from TNK-BP until the board is back to its full strength .  That hits the UK oil group where it hurts : TNK-BP has returned $ 19bn to BP since its formation in 2003 , $ 3.7bn of that in 2011 alone .  That represented a massive 17 per cent of BP 's cash flow from operations last year .  However , the turmoil at TNK-BP is just one of the problems facing the UK group .  Its share price is still more than a third down on pre-Gulf of Mexico oil spill levels , and still trails peers such as Royal Dutch Shell .  Its inability to draw a line under the Deepwater Horizon incident - and to calculate its ultimate cost - is weighing heavily on its stock .  Some progress has been achieved in clarifying the final bill .  In March , BP reached an agreement with lawyers representing individuals and businesses affected by the spill , which included an estimated $ 7.8bn in payments for economic loss and medical claims .  That could finally bring an end to civil litigation with private plaintiffs .  But civil litigation with the US federal government and US states along the gulf coast has yet to be resolved .  The Department of Justice is also continuing its criminal investigation .  One big unknown is whether BP will be found guilty of gross negligence over the spill - a move that will significantly increase the scale of the fines for which it is liable .  Any failure to settle with the DoJ means a trial that "" could take years to conclude and leave the dispute over whether there was gross negligence overhanging the shares "" , says Mr Pether .  BP insists it is recovering from the near-fatal blow it suffered in 2010 .  It has restored its dividend and , once it has finished paying into the $ 20bn escrow fund it established in 2010 to pay for Deepwater Horizonrelated costs and claims , its cash position will change dramatically .  Operating cash flow is due to increase 50 per cent by 2014 compared with 2011 , half of that thanks to new upstream projects in high-margin areas such as the North Sea , Angola and the Gulf of Mexico .  And it says half of the increase will be paid out to shareholders and used to pay down net debt , which at the end of March was $ 31.2bn , compared with $ 27.5bn the previous year .  BP denies that it lacks direction .  "" We spent all of 2011 stabilising the company , "" it says .  "" And we 've now set out a very clear direction , with clear targets and milestones over the next few years . ""  Indeed , investors have welcomed the promises on cash flow .  "" But they do need to communicate to the market how that cash is going to be deployed , "" says Jason Gammel , an oil analyst at Macquarie Securities .  "" And you 're not going to get a full answer to that until you 've got clarity with the DoJ . ""  For now , the picture that investors have of the company is pretty uninspiring , says Mr Gammel .  "" There 's a relative lack of opportunity in BP 's portfolio , "" he says .  "" It has major capital projects that will basically offset the decline rates elsewhere .  But outside Russia , it does n't appear to us to be a growth company . ""  Others are more upbeat .  "" BP is fighting back , "" says Will Riley , co-manager of Guinness Global Energy Fund .  "" Investors need to be patient while they try to right the ship . ""  Meanwhile , the dispute with its Russian partners in TNK-BP , the AAR consortium , rumbles on .  BP tried and failed to buy AAR out last year with Rosneft 's help for about $ 34bn , but the deal fell apart .  AAR says that it would itself like to buy BP out , but that outcome , too , is unlikely .  Moscow is currently awash with rumours that Igor Sechin , Russia 's energy tsar , who was recently appointed chief executive of Rosneft and has been empowered by the return of his friend Vladimir Putin to the Russian presidency , could make a move against AAR , perhaps folding their stake into Rosneft .  Meanwhile , investors watch bewildered from the sidelines .  "" With TNK-BP , the only way you know what 's going to happen is when it 's happening , "" says one former executive at the company .",FT other BP
04-05-2005,403,"Corixa purchase proposal boosts GSK PHARMACEUTICALS  Shares in GlaxoSmithKline rose yesterday after it agreed to buy Corixa , a US biotechnology company , for Dollars 300m ( Pounds 159m ) in cash , which gives the UK-based pharmaceuticals group access to a key ingredient used in its vaccines . Shareholders in Corixa , which develops products that regulate the immune system , will receive Dollars 4.40 a share from GSK , a premium of almost 48 per cent compared with the share price before the announcement . GSK already owns about 8 per cent of Corixa and said a further 11 per cent of shareholders had agreed to vote in favour of the proposed deal .  The transaction is subject to shareholder approval and regulatory clearance , but is expected to be closed in the third quarter of this year . GSK said the move was of strategic importance to its vaccines division .  Buying Corixa will give GSK monophosphoryl lipid A , a novel adjuvant - an ingredient that is added to a drug to increase its effect . MPL is already contained in many of the vaccines in the UK drugmaker 's pipeline , including Cervarix , a potential blockbuster vaccine that targets the human papillomavirus , a common sexually-transmitted disease linked to cervical cancer . GSK yesterday unveiled fresh clinical trial data on Cervarix , which said it provides wide protection against several different strains of the virus . Cervarix is expected to reach the market in 2006 , although Merck of the US has a rival vaccine in development . The proposed Corixa deal would mean GSK would no longer incur MPL-related royalties on future sales of Cervarix or other vaccines containing the ingredient . GSK said it would acquire all assets related to a preventative tuberculosis vaccine and a portfolio of cancer vaccines being developed by GSK Biologicals that contained antigens discovered by Corixa after the two companies began a collaboration in 1998 .  GSK shares rallied last week after the company 's first-quarter results .  It announced a settlement with US regulators over drug manufacturing problems at its Puerto Rico plant that had led to a halt in distribution of Paxil CR , an antidepressant , and Avandament , a diabetes drug . The shares , which have outperformed the sector by 12 per cent over the past year , rose 28p to Pounds 13.40 .",FT other GSK
12-05-2012,405,"GSK turns hostile with $ 2.6bn bid for HGS  GlaxoSmithKline has formally turned its $ 2.6bn bid for Human Genome Sciences hostile , after its un-solicited approach to the US drug developer was dismissed last month .  The British pharmaceuticals group yesterday said it would not take part in the review of strategic alternatives - which could include a sale - announced by HGS after the offer , but would instead take its $13-a-share cash offer directly to HGS shareholders .  "" It is important for HGS shareholders to understand that GSK is committed to proceeding with its offer , "" GSK said , adding that its offer was not conditional on due diligence or financing .  It also claimed that the 20 business days for which its offer would remain open would give Nasdaq-listed HGS enough time to complete its review .  The move reflects an intensification of acquisition activity in the healthcare sector of late , and follows a hostile $ 6.8bn bid by Roche for Illumina , a US diagnostics company , which it withdrew last month .  GSK executives working on the deal have indicated they may not raise the bid , which they consider strong .  The $ 13 offer is 81 per cent higher than the closing price of HGS shares the day before GSK 's approach was revealed publicly .  However , HGS shares which have traded higher than the offer price since GSK was rebuffed , closed down 0.2 per cent to $ 14.59 in New York .  GSK shares , which have edged lower since last month 's offer was confirmed , closed down 1.39 per cent at £ 14.04 .  HGS said yesterday it would "" carefully review and consider the offer "" and make a recommendation within 10 days .  GSK has been working with HGS on Benlysta , which treats lupus , an autoimmune condition .  The drug was rejected for use by the UK 's National Health Service as not cost effective .  The joint development and commercialisation agreement allocates Benlysta 's US sales to HGS and elsewhere to GSK .  GSK envisages cost savings and greater potential for sales using its own commercial organisation following a full takeover .  HGS said $ 13 a share undervalued the company after GSK 's initial approach last month .  GSK had been invited to participate in the review , HGS said last month , but there was no assurance of a deal .  There have long been rumours that GSK would make a bid for HGS , which also produces raxibacumab , a treatment for inhalation anthrax .  HGS was one of the first biotech companies to emerge in the early 1990s following efforts to map the human genome .",FT other GSK
18-05-2012,407,"HGSI fights GSK bid with ' poison pill '  Human Genome Sciences stepped up its defence against GlaxoSmithKline 's $ 2.6bn hostile takeover bid with a "" poison pill "" and claims of talks with alternative buyers .  The US-based biotech said in a statement that it had "" engaged in discussions with a number of other parties , including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies , regarding a potential transaction . . . including , but not limited to , a sale "" .  The announcement came as the company formally rejected as "" inadequate "" GSK 's $ 13 a share cash offer , which was launched last week to shareholders after it was rejected by the board .  It also announced a poison pill designed to dilute the stake of a hostile bidder .  It said the GSK proposal significantly undervalued HGSI , which declared in a regulatory filing that it had $ 2.6bn in net operating loss carry-forwards and research and development tax credits alone .  The company said GSK - which estimates it can achieve annual cost savings of $ 200m following the takeover - had "" opportunistically "" tried to capitalise on a one-year low in HGSI 's stock price ahead of a series of future milestones for drug study findings and approvals .  GSK replied that its offer - at an 81 per cent premium to the closing share price just ahead of the bid - "" represents full and fair value "" .  It already has close links with HGSI , with joint development and commercialisation agreements for Benlysta , a medicine approved for lupus ; darapladib and albiglutide , its other leading experimental drugs ; and rilapladib , an earlier stage medicine in development to treat Alzheimer 's disease .  Three HGSI directors also serve on advisory boards with links to GSK .  HGSI said GSK had rights until at least patent expiry in 2023 on Benlysta unless either company "" commits a material breach "" of their agreement .  It said Thomas Watkins , the chief executive , would receive $ 21m in shares , options and severance payments in the event of the takeover and his departure .  The filing said that Sir Andrew Witty , GSK 's chief executive , contacted Mr Watkins on April 11 to propose the cash offer .  At a meeting a week later , the HGSI board concluded this did not reflect the full value of Benlysta and darapladib and sought to launch a search for strategic alternatives .  GSK refused to participate in the process and launched its offer .  HGSI appointed Credit Suisse alongside Goldman Sachs as financial advisers , as Goldman Sachs had a conflict because of "" capped call transactions "" , which would pay out to the bank if GSK 's bid succeeded .  HGSI estimated Benlysta 's US sales potential at $ 7bn a year for an initial 200,000 lupus patients , with scope to expand to other similar diseases , although GSK 's response appeared to question the market size for Benlysta .  It said there was a "" multibillion-dollar market opportunity "" for darapladib , on which it would receive post-approval a 10 per cent worldwide royalty from GSK and 20 per cent profit share in Europe and North America .  Mark Evans of THS Partners in London , which owns more than 5 per cent of HGSI , called for GSK to pay a higher price , arguing its bid did not reflect "" control or for cost synergies "" .",FT other GSK
23-05-2005,409,"Pharmaceuticals company moves to stop diversion of Aids drugs GLAXOSMITHKLINE :  GlaxoSmithKline , the pharmaceuticals group that is the largest single supplier of humanitarian Aids drugs for developing countries , has said it is close to implementing tough measures to stem the illegal diversion of these medicines back into developed countries .  The company aims by the end of this year to have fully implemented an anti-fraud identification system , including packaging , labelling and a red coating on the Combivir and Epivir antiretroviral tablets it supplies at cost to the poorest countries .  The tablets sold at commercial rates are white .  Recent prosecutions have revealed widespread diversion of drugs destined for the poorest countries , which are intercepted by criminal intermediaries , repackaged and re-exported for re-sale at much higher retail prices .  Dowelhurst , a UK-based company , is expected in the coming days to make a cash payment to Aids charities following a long-running legal dispute , after GSK accused it of involvement in the sale in Europe of anti-retroviral drugs that had been destined for Africa .  Dowelhurst is licensed to undertake legal "" parallel trade "" to take advantage of pharmaceutical price differences between European countries , and stressed that it had purchased the drugs in good faith .  Graham Satchwell , a former policeman who heads Proco Solutions , a consultancy that tracks the diversion of drugs , said the problem was growing .  "" I have been involved investigating a dozen cases of large-scale diversion of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products , including four or five involving antiretrovirals . ""  While working for GSK , Mr Satchwell led Operation Highlighter , an investigation into the diversion of its Aids drugs from their intended destination of Senegal .  His inquiries have led to legal actions in France , Switzerland and other European countries .  GSK is separately pursuing a series of other investigations , including one involving the diversion of drugs it supplied to Kenya .  The litigations mark a more aggressive approach by the group to tackling misuse of its drugs .  Until recently , the pharmaceutical industry has sought to avoid the negative publicity associated with the illegal trade in medicines .  GSK , which estimates that it provides two-fifths of humanitarian antiretroviral supplies , said that up to a quarter of the drugs by volume was illegally diverted in 2002 , the first full year of its low-cost deliveries , although it believed the proportion has declined since then .  The company knew there was a risk of diversion when the programme began three years ago , but preferred to begin the low-cost supplies immediately rather than await lengthy regulatory approvals for new packaging and colouring .  The efforts against the illegal diversion of cheap drugs come at a time of intensifying pressure by the pharmaceutical industry against legal parallel trade by companies , including Dowelhurst .  Drugs manufacturers have been lobbying governments to reduce or eliminate parallel trading , arguing that it benefits only the intermediaries , rather than providing profits to fund future research , or cost savings for national health systems .",FT other GSK

31-05-12,413,"GSK in push to replace takeover target 's board  GlaxoSmithKline has begun a process to try to replace the entire board of Human Genome Sciences , adding pressure to the unsolicited $ 2.6bn bid it made for the US biotech company in April , according to people familiar with situation .  GSK has contacted pharmaceutical executives , finance and governance experts who could potentially take over HGS 's 12-member board as independent directors through a consent solicitation process , these people said .  HGS 's corporate bylaws allow its shareholders to trigger a change of board control without calling a meeting , an situation GSK signalled it might take advantage of in a regulatory filing this month .  Once it has its proposed directors in place , the UK-listed pharmaceutical company would file its plan with regulators and send consent solicitation letters to HGS 's shareholders , who would then decide whether or not to send a request for change .  But people familiar with consent solicitations said the process was a tactic designed to pressure HGS into a deal , and that a replacement of the board was not necessarily the most likely outcome .  Instead , HGS shareholders are likely to pressure their board to engage in more serious discussions with GSK .  The shareholders may ask GSK for a slight increase in the offer price of $ 13 per share .  Ten institutional shareholders together own more than 75 per cent of HGS 's stock , and pressure from a large enough block of them could trigger a deal .  Some investors have already demonstrated their frustration with HGS , this month suing the company for adopting a poison pill .  GSK launched its bid earlier this year , but HGS rejected it and said it was beginning a strategic review .  GSK already has tight links with the US biotech group , with which it is jointly commercialising Benlysta , and a partnership involving other leading experimental drugs .  GSK 's tender offer expires on June 7 , but people close to the situation said that date would probably be extended as it pursued the consent solicitation process .  HGS has said other parties are interested , but analysts see bids as unlikely given the ties with GSK .  HGS stepped up its defence yesterday by accusing GSK of attempting to "" disrupt "" its strategic review .  GSK refused to comment .  Its plans to replace the HGS board were first reported by Reuters .",FT other GSK
09-05-2012,415,"HSBC delivers 25 % rise in profits  Investment banking revenues expand  Chief unfazed by election results   The euro could survive an exit by Greece , HSBC predicted yesterday , as it announced that first-quarter underlying profit had risen 25 per cent year on year to $ 6.78bn .  Stuart Gulliver , the bank 's chief executive , said Greece 's future within the European single currency would be a matter for its politicians following the electoral success of parties opposed to austerity measures at the weekend .  "" If hypothetically Greece was to leave the eurozone , I do n't think that results in the rest of the eurozone breaking up , "" Mr Gulliver said , adding that HSBC 's exposure to Greece was small .  He also played down the victory of François Hollande , the socialist , in the French presidential election .  HSBC has a significant presence in France .  "" We remain quite sanguine . . .  I do n't see it today as a significant worry , "" Mr Gulliver said .  He added that the UK was right to continue to focus on austerity measures , arguing that financial markets had rewarded it for its attempt to curb spending .  HSBC said the rise in underlying profit reflected increased revenues in its investment banking and commercial banking arms .  Finance director Iain Mackay said the bank would continue to pursue growth in the UK mortgage market - in line with Royal Bank of Scotland but in contrast to Lloyds and Santander UK , which have pledged to cut their market share .  HSBC now has a 5.8 per cent share of the market , compared with 5.3 per cent a year ago .  The group 's statutory pre-tax profit , which included a $ 2.64bn accounting loss related to fluctuations in the value of its issued debt , was $ 4.32bn for the first three months of the year , down from $ 4.91bn in the first quarter of 2011 .  Impairment charges - money set aside against soured loans - were broadly flat year on year , at $ 2.37bn .  However , recent signs of a blip in the growth trend in Brazil pushed up loan losses there by about $ 250m .  Mr Gulliver pledged that Brazil "" wo n't become another Household "" - a reference to the troubled US consumer finance arm that has dragged down HSBC 's performance since 2007 .  HSBC absorbed a $ 468m charge for compensating customers who had been mis-sold payment protection insurance , a form of loan cover that had been a big earner for UK banks .  It had already made $ 717m of PPI provisions in 2011 .  Mr Gulliver added to criticism by Lloyds Banking Group of the claims management companies that pursue PPI compensation on behalf of individuals .

The deal , at nearly twice the Dollars 600m paid by HSBC for its first 10 per cent , will speed HSBC 's entry into China 's fast-growing insurance market by giving it access to Ping An 's 20m policy holders and 250,000 sales agents .  China 's insurance market is forecast to double in value from Dollars 50bn in the next three years .  The transaction will yield a 14-fold return on the original investment made by the private equity arms of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - one of the largest windfalls earned by foreign investors in a Chinese company .  The two US investment banks bought a combined 12.7 per cent stake in Ping An for about Dollars 70m in 1994 - one of the first private equity investments in a Chinese company .  Their holding was reduced to about 10 per cent when the Chinese insurer sold shares on the Hong Kong market in a Dollars 1.8bn initial public offering last year .

17-05-2012,419,"HSBC customer loses damages case  HSBC has won an important court case against a wealthy customer who sued its private bank after it reported transactions from his account as being "" suspicious "" .  The case has been closely watched by other banks who were concerned that they could be exposed to legal action by customers for simply complying with their obligations under the Proceeds of Crime Act .  The banking sector files thousands of suspicious activity transactions , or SARs , to the Serious Organised Crime Agency each year .  At the High Court yesterday Mr Justice Supperstone ruled in favour of HSBC and dismissed a $ 300m claim for damages brought by Jayesh Shah and his wife , who have business interests in central Africa and Zimbabwe .  The long-running case centred on Mr Shah , a customer with HSBC Private Bank for eight years , who transferred $ 28m to his HSBC account in London from an account at Crédit Agricole , the French bank .  When he tried to transfer most of the money back to Crédit Agricole in 2006 , he was told by HSBC that "" it could not effect the transaction because it was complying with its UK statutory obligations "" as the bank had made a suspicious activity report to a regulatory authority .  In each case , HSBC told Mr and Mrs Shah that it was complying with its statutory obligations but declined to provide any further information to them or their solicitors .  The couple alleged that they were stigmatised in Zimbabwe and suspected of criminal activity because of HSBC , causing authorities there to freeze and seize their assets .  Mr Shah denied any involvement in money laundering and the transfers eventually took place .  The ruling found that it was not HSBC 's delay in executing the payment instructions and its failure to provide information but the Zimbabwean authorities ' own pre-existing or independent concerns that led to the losses by the claimants .  Mr Justice Supperstone also said in that "" in my judgment Mr Shah was able to , but did not , take reasonable steps to mitigate or avoid his loss "" .  Daren Allen , partner at Berwin Leighton Paisner , who acted for HSBC in the case , said there had been considerable debate about the obligations owed to the customer of a bank when it had made a suspicious activity report to the Serious Organised Crime Agency .  He said the court decision would "" be welcomed by firms who feared they may be liable for damages for simply complying with their legal obligations under the Proceeds of Crime Act "" .

From August , HSBC will allow any of the 1,419 law firms accredited with the Law Society 's Conveyancing Quality Scheme ( CQS ) to carry out legal work for the bank and for the borrower .  The move follows months of complaints from homebuyers and lawyers about long delays and the breakdown of property chains due to the bank 's announcement in January that customers would have to use their reduced solicitor panel - or use their own solicitor and pay an extra fee of £192 ( £ 160 , plus VAT ) to cover HSBC 's legal work .  Homebuyers said the lender 's insistence on using a small panel of firms has caused months of delays to purchases .  Customers have described the process a "" nightmare "" , causing added stress and worry .  Other homebuyers said they nearly missed out on the stamp duty holiday for properties purchased up to the value of £ 250,000 , which ended on March 24 , as a result of the delays .  But , while HSBC 's decision to allow CQS accredited firms will dramatically widen the choice for homebuyers from August , it will not help the position of those currently buying a property with the lender .  Brokers said the problem has been accentuated by HSBC offering competitive mortgage deals , particulary for first-time buyers .  "" HSBC has been plagued with service issues and delays , partly caused by a limited conveyancing panel and also by offering some of the ' best-buy ' mortgage rates on the market , "" said Adrian Anderson of Anderson Harris , a mortgage broker .

25-05-2005,423,"HSBC plans expansion in emerging markets CONSUMER FINANCE :  HSBC has begun its expansion in consumer finance in emerging markets including China , India , Mexico and Turkey , by targeting lower-income customers with the techniques of Household International , the US company it acquired for USDollars 13bn in 2003 .  The roll out of the Household model , which focuses on savers rejected by banks because of their poor credit history , is a crucial part of the UK-based bank 's efforts to sustain profit growth in the face of increased competition and a slowing global economy .  "" This is a major programme for us .  We are working hard in a number of countries , "" Stephen Green , HSBC 's chief executive , said yesterday .  "" We intend to carry ( the Household model ) into other markets , such as China , India , Mexico and Turkey . ""  After a meeting with Hong Kong-based shareholders , Mr Green said two senior executives from the former Household business , now called HSBC Finance , had been moved from Chicago to the territory to oversee the Asian expansion .  Household 's model - borrowing funds at low interest rates and lending them out at much higher ones to "" sub-prime "" customers - has become a key driver of profit growth at HSBC .  In 2004 , the personal finance business , which includes credit cards , accounted for about 30 per cent of group profit .  Emerging markets , where millions of people remain outside the banking system , are a natural target for HSBC Finance , which will use Household 's technology and statistical techniques to pick customers with a low chance of defaulting .  However , some analysts warn the lower level of sophistication of financial regulations in some emerging markets could make it more difficult for HSBC to minimise the risks tied to "" sub-prime "" customers .  In China , HSBC is expected to pioneer the Household model through its credit card joint venture with Bank of Communications , the country 's fifth-largest lender , in which it owns a 19.9 per cent stake .

28-05-2005,425,"HSBC sees ' marked ' rise in bad debts  HSBC added to concerns about consumer debt yesterday , saying it had seen a "" marked "" increase in bad and doubtful debts in the first quarter .  Sir John Bond , chairman , told the bank 's annual meeting that recent rises in interest rates and a slowing housing market were affecting consumer confidence and the level of bad debts .  "" We have seen a noticeable and marked increase in bad and doubtful debts in unsecured personal lending , but this is entirely manageable for HSBC , "" Sir John said .  His comments followed Thursday 's report from Barclays of a significant rise in bad debt losses .  UK consumer debt has risen to more than Pounds 1,000bn , but while high-street retailers have suffered from a slowdown in spending there had been little evidence of borrowers defaulting .  Analysts were unconcerned about HSBC 's situation in the UK and said the increase in bad debts had been flagged by the group at its full-year results in February and again in April .  Peter Toeman , at Morgan Stanley , said : "" This does n't represent a sea change for HSBC as it did with Barclays .  It is a recognition of what was already evident . ""  James Hamilton , at WestLB , added that the UK made up a much smaller proportion of HSBC 's business than it did for most other UK-listed banks , though he cautioned that the UK was close to the top of the economic cycle .  "" We normally only see provisioning expectations change as the cycle is well into turning down , "" he said .  Shares in the group , which rose 5p on Thursday as other banks ' stock took a hit , slipped 2p to 868p yesterday .  Barclays lost further ground yesterday .  Analysts were more concerned at what the near future held for HSBC in the US .  Mr Toeman said US bankruptcies were picking up ahead of a change in legislation and while the bank 's US business had a positive first quarter , that could be "" as good as it gets "" .  Sir John told shareholders that recent trends in US payroll and employment data suggested economic momentum had been sustained .  He added that credit experience at Household International , the US consumer finance business it bought in 2003 , had continued to improve .  However , consumer finance lends to customers often refused finance by banks , and one analyst said these were the kinds of people likely to lose their jobs first in any downturn .

04-05-2005,427,"Shell hopes loss of Omani field is just a warning : The company may be better suited than Occidental to develop Mukhaizna , writes James Boxell  Royal Dutch / Shell 's loss of the right to develop the Mukhaizna field in Oman is a serious blow to the oil company as it tries to recover from last year 's reserves overbooking scandal .  For although this part of Oman currently only produces 10,000 barrels of oil a day - minuscule compared with the 3.8m barrels Shell extracts around the world - Oman is Shell country .  Yet , having agreed a deal with Shell six months ago , the sultanate appeared to change its mind and this weekend handed the contract instead to Occidental Petroleum of the US .  Occidental has promised the Omani government that , by spending Dollars 2bn ( Pounds 1.1bn ) , it can increase production from the 2.4bn-barrel field - Oman 's sixth largest - to 150,000 barrels a day within the next few years .  This is almost double what Shell promised .  Stewart Johnstone , vice-president of Charles River Associates , the consultancy group , who works regularly for Middle East governments , says : "" The loss of the field is a blow to Shell 's reputation in the longer term . ""  Shell has been active in Oman since the 1930s and was almost solely responsible for the development of the country 's oil industry .  Oman is now Shell 's most important source of oil after the US , Nigeria and the UK .  While other international companies bailed out of Oman in 1960 , after failing to find any significant oil , Shell stuck it out and was rewarded by a series of big finds from 1962 onwards .  Oman has never been one of the Middle East 's biggest hydrocarbon repositories - its reserves are estimated at 5.5bn barrels of oil - but Shell helped put it on the map as a producer .  Colin Lothian , analyst at Wood Mackenzie , the oil industry consultancy group , says : "" They took it from nothing to more than 800,000 barrels a day ( in the 1990s ) . ""  The loss of Mukhaizna is particularly embarrassing for Shell as it comes just months after it signed an extension to its concession in Oman that gives it rights to develop most of the country 's oil and gas fields for the next 40 years .  The Mukhaizna field was part of that deal and Shell is in talks with the government that could result in the company relinquishing a further 10 per cent of the concession area , although it insists this is standard practice and that it can refuse to give up important fields .  The company has relied in the past on the excellent relations between the British government and Sultan Qaboos bin Said , a graduate of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst who was educated privately in Britain from the age of 16 .  British military advisers helped the Sultan to depose his father in a palace coup in 1970 , after the old isolationist Sultan 's insistence on using oil revenues exclusively to fund defence had embarrassed his UK allies and Shell .  However , one person close to the Omani government says that the country 's energy minister , Mohammed al-Rumhi , a trained petroleum engineer , is less favourably inclined towards Shell following four years of declining production .  "" There has been quite a bit of friction at the working level between Shell and the ministry , "" the person says .  Shell will be concerned particularly about any perception that it is losing favour in Oman because of its inability to use technology to squeeze more oil from difficult reservoirs .  It prides itself on its technology and hopes that this will give it an advantage as other Middle Eastern governments look to enhance recovery from fields - an area of business that will be extremely important for international oil companies in the next few years .  Mr Johnstone at Charles River says : "" When they try to get concessions elsewhere there will be questions raised , probably by competitors , on whether they have the skills to do it . ""  However , Mr Johnstone says , there is a possibility that Occidental could have overpromised on its plans for Mukhaizna .  Shell believes that it has more experience of the advanced technology needed to extract the heavy oil from the field , which injects steam to heat up the dense oil to make it less sticky .  It owns 52 per cent of Aera , a company that uses the technique on 6,000 wells in the US .  Shell says that it will maintain an equity interest in Mukhaizna through Petroleum Development Oman , the owner of the Oman concession in which it holds a 34 per cent stake .  It will hope the loss of control amounts to nothing more than a "" slap on the wrist "" to get production going again , as Mr Johnstone suggests , rather than something more permanent .",FT other Shell
22-05-2012,429,"Activists query intervention for Shell  UK steps in over Niger Delta claims  Legal brief in US case raises concerns   The UK government is facing pressure from human rights activists about its decision to intervene in a US court case connected to Royal Dutch Shell , the oil major  The UK government and the Dutch government have jointly filed a so-called "" amicus brief "" to the US Supreme Court on the side of Shell in the long-running Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum case .  This lawsuit was brought by Niger Delta communities , which are suing the oil company .  The case has been brought in the US under the controversial Alien Tort statute , a 1789 law that is used by human rights lawyers to sue multinational companies in US courts over involvement in alleged human rights abuses abroad .  At stake in the Shell case is the fundamental legal principle that corporations can be sued for civil wrongs in US civil courts just as any individual .  The Alien Tort Statute lay dormant until the 1980s , when human rights lawyers began employing it in lawsuits against companies .  The Corporate Responsibility Coalition ( Core ) , a group of human rights and environmental non-government organisations , has said it is now seeking to find out why the UK government has chosen to get involved in the case .  Amnesty , one of the groups involved , has urged the UK 's foreign affairs select committee to ask the Foreign Office why it has intervened .  It also notes that the US government is siding with the petitioners , who want to see corporations continue to be liable under international law .  Marilyn Croser , co-ordinator of Core , argues that it is crucial to have the Alien Tort statute to be able to bring lawsuits in the US .  She said : "" Victims of corporate human rights abuses in developing countries face huge obstacles when they try to access justice .  "" As shown in this case , local systems often do not deliver , making it essential to have avenues such as the US Alien Tort Claims Act . ""  Shell did not wish to comment on the court case .  The Foreign Office said in a statement that the UK had a strong reputation as a defender of human rights .  It said : "" The UK / Dutch brief is concerned solely with the position under international law of the following issues : liability of corporations for human rights violations , extraterritoriality and the exhaustion of local remedies . ""  It added : "" We believe that human rights obligations rest with states - and not with non-state actors such as corporations .  "" It is the UK 's wellestablished position that corporations can and should be held to account for their activities before a court which can exercise jurisdiction over those activities in accordance with established rules of international law .

23-05-2012,431,"Shell defends pay and plans for Alaska  Environmental campaigners and shareholders clashed with Royal Dutch Shell at an annual meeting dominated by concerns over exploration in Alaska , slow progress tackling oil leakages in Nigeria , dividend policy and executive pay .  Shell , which faced criticism from retail investors at the meeting over pay increases for top executives , said that 9 per cent of its shareholders voted against its remuneration report .  In March it revealed chief executive Peter Voser took home EUR11.7m last year , more than double his pay in the previous 12 months , after lucrative long-term incentive plans paid out .  However , Mr Voser , along with the head of Shell 's remuneration committee Hans Wijers and other directors , were re-elected by overwhelming votes of 99 per cent or more to the board in spite of the revolt on pay .  Shell said its "" remuneration policy firmly links executive compensation with the performance of the company "" .  The shares , which rose 11 per cent in 2011 but are down 15 per cent this year , yesterday gained 41.5p to £ 20.86½p .  Amid tight security at venues in The Hague in the Netherlands and London , Shell 's chairman Jorma Ollila and Mr Voser politely batted away dozens of questions criticising the environmental record of the Anglo-Dutch oil major .  Shell said it was still in talks with the Nigerian government and other parties about how best to proceed with proposals to spend $ 1bn on a clean-up and rehabilitation of the polluted areas of Ogoniland in the Niger Delta .  During protracted but generally well-tempered questioning on Shell 's handling of its Nigerian operations , one Dutch shareholder said : "" I do n't want to be ashamed , and I do n't want to sell my shares . ""  The company , which in March was issued with a claim for damages over two oil spills in the delta in 2008 , said it was keen to push ahead with the investment in remedying the pollution damage .  Mr Voser accepted that Shell bore much of the operational responsibility for oil spills but insisted the bulk of continuing spillage was the result of "" illegal bunkering and refining "" .  Mr Ollila also defended Shell 's ability to develop oilfields safely in Arctic waters as it prepares for exploratory drilling , in the face of arguments from a representative of local native Americans that the project ran a substantial risk of ecological devastation .  "" It is 50 years since the industry took its first steps of drilling in the Arctic , "" he said .  He also defended Shell 's position of offering no increase in quarterly dividend payments of 42 cents over three years since 2009 .  Shell nudged the payment up by a 1 cent to 43 cents in April .  "" Last year we represented 12 per cent of all dividends on the FTSE 100 , "" he said .",FT other Shell

28-05-2005,435,"Shell 's second cut more serious OIL & GAS  Royal Dutch / Shell has underlined the seriousness of its second reserves cut last year by estimating that the barrels of oil and gas removed were more valuable than those in its first , far bigger reduction .  The Anglo-Dutch oil group was initially forced to cut its proved oil and gas reserves by about 4.5bn barrels early last year , but was embarrassed in October when it admitted that a further restatement would be needed .  The second cut overshadowed the historic proposal to merge Shell 's Dutch and British holding companies in response to investor criticism about the reserves scandal .  In its annual report , published yesterday , Shell said the net present value of the 4.5bn barrels cut in the first restatement was about Dollars 6.65bn ( Pounds 3.65bn ) , when applied to the year 2002 .  However , the value of the second cut when applied to the same year was about Dollars 5.4bn , even though only 1.15bn barrels were removed , which was less than a third of the first reduction .  Shell said in the report that the majority of the barrels removed in the second restatement were in "" higher margin areas "" and in fields that were already producing , giving them a greater value .  Africa , which is dominated by Shell 's Nigerian operations , accounted for about 35 per cent of the second cut , Asia 26 per cent , Europe 21 per cent , the Middle East 3 per cent and the rest of the world 15 per cent .  The first restatement focused on long-term projects such as the Gorgon gas field in Australia where revenues were not expected for years , giving them a lower present value .  Separately yesterday , Shell said it would miss its 2008 deadline for ending the environmentally damaging practice of burning-off waste gas in Nigeria .  The Nigerian government has warned that companies that failed to meet the deadline would face punishment , including fines .  In its yearly Shell Report , which focuses on environmental , social and governance issues , the company said flaring cuts were "" behind schedule "" and that it now expects to stop flaring in 2009 .",FT other Shell

Shares in the Anglo-Dutch company , whose brands include Dove soap and Lipton tea , rose 13 1/2p to 529p .  Analysts and investors had been wary of poor first-quarter results from Unilever , which has struggled with declining sales in recent years .  The company 's executives acknowledged that much work remained to improve its market share against competitors such as Procter & Gamble of the US .  But Unilever said its competitive position had improved over the past six months , with sales growing 2 per cent in the first quarter compared to a year earlier , excluding the impact of extra trading days .  Most of the increase was down to healthy sales of Unilever products in emerging markets .  In Asia and Africa , the company 's underlying sales rose by some 7 per cent .  Europe remained weak even as the company cut prices to try and improve its competitive position , and sales dropped 2 per cent .  Sales rose 4 per cent in the Americas .  Pre-tax profit was up 8.5 per cent to Euros 1.28bn ( Pounds 867m ) .  Analysts said it is too early to tell whether the first-quarter rise in underlying sales growth would be sustained .

Mr Colao 's total remuneration includes a leap in long-term bonus , as Vodafone exceeded targets for adjusted free cash flow and total shareholder return in comparison with rivals such as BT , France Telecom and Telefónica .  According to Vodafone 's annual report , published on Friday , the total value of the shares awarded to Mr Colao under the company 's long-term incentive scheme almost tripled from £ 3.75m to £ 10.99m .

In May , Vodafone announced a 1.3 per cent rise in revenues to £ 46.4bn for the 12 months to March 31 , while pre-tax profit was flat at £ 9.5bn , with a £ 4bn impairment charge for poor performance in rapidly weakening European markets .

The group attributed a £ 4bn impairment charge in its annual results to lower cash flows from the struggling economies of Italy , Spain, Portugal and Greece .  The drop in spending by cash-strapped consumers in southern Europe and tougher government regulation prompted the company to cut its medium-term revenue growth target by 1 percentage point to a range of 0-3 per cent .

"" We are delivering robust numbers given the circumstances .  It is not the results that are disappointing , it is the economies in some of our markets .

Service revenues in Europe fell 1.1 per cent compared to the previous year , weighed down by regulated cuts to wholesale charges paid to rival providers for connecting calls , known as mobile termination rates .  The story was different in the US where Verizon Wireless , the mobile operator 45 per cent owned by Vodafone , reported service revenues up 7.3 per cent year on year , contributing £ 4.9bn of profit to the British group .  Annual sales from data rose 22.2 per cent , driven by the ever-growing popularity of smartphones , and now represents almost 15 per cent of the group 's total service revenues .

In the 12 months to March 31 , Vodafone reported flat pre-tax profit of £ 9.5bn from revenues up from £ 45.8bn to £ 46.4bn .  Diluted earnings per share fell from 15.11p to 13.65p , and a final dividend of 6.47p was proposed , up from 6.05p , bringing the total payout to shareholders for the year - including a 4p special dividend - to 13.52p , a rise of 51.9 per cent from the previous year .

The "" environment is ripe for a deal that could make both sides happy , "" Goldman 's team told clients .

This would see the US group pay for part of Vodafone 's stake using debt borrowed against Wireless 's assets , then use the cash generated by the business to purchase the remainder on pre-agreed terms . Taking such a route would mean Verizon could take full control of Wireless inside four years without over-stretching its own balance sheet , Goldman said .

8-02-2007,451,"Goodyear to leave BHP Billiton MINING BHP Billiton , the world 's biggest miner , surprised investors with plans to return Dollars 10bn ( Pounds 5.1bn ) in share buy-backs and search for a new chief executive after the incumbent Chip Goodyear said he plannedto leave at the end ofthe year . That news overshadowed the half-year earnings results , which were slightly short of analysts forecasts . Investors were nevertheless pleased with the buy-back and pushed BHP Billiton shares up 54 1/2p to Pounds 10.40. BHP reported a 41 per cent jump in first-half net profit to Dollars 6.17bn ( Dollars 4.36bn ) on higher metal prices and said China would continue as the main driver of demand for raw materials . Jason Fairclough , mining analyst at Merrill Lynch , said the first- half earnings were about3 per cent below estimates . The increase in the mining group 's capital management programme - by more than four times to Dollars 13bn - would be carried out through a series of buy-backs over the next 18 months , beginning with a Dollars 2.5bn off-market return in Australia . Analysts said the buy-back , which surprised the market in its scale , indicated the company 's confidence in its outlook . "" It is pretty amazing and basically what they are saying is they are confident to generate an awful lot of cash over the next 18 months , and they are happy it give it back to shareholders , "" said Mark Daniels , director of equities with Aberdeen Asset Management . In contrast , Mr Fairclough said : "" We believe that declining prices for base metals could put pressure on miners in general and limit upside from the buy-back . "" As with rival Rio Tinto , which last week reported a 25 per cent gain in half-year profit to Dollars 3.59bn , BHP 's base metals division and petroleum unit made a weighty contribution . BHP , which has 29 projects worth Dollars 17.5bn in construction or at the feasibility stage , increased its first-half dividend 14 per cent to 20 cents . Mr Goodyear , who in 2005 oversaw the ADollars 9.2bn ( Pounds 3.6bn ) takeover of WMC Resources , the Australian base metals and uranium company , dismissed suggestions the succession at BHP would distract its pursuit of acquisitions and that the company had not been aggressive enough in pursuing growth . "" We do look for opportunities to acquire things , but we look for value and that is the ultimate driver , whether it is organic or mergers and acquisitions , "" Mr Goodyear said . He reaffirmed BHP 's commitment to its oil assets in the Gulf of Mexico . Additional reporting by Kevin Morrison .",goodyear to leave bhp billiton mining
2-09-2013,453,"Hard to call size of Vodafone payout mobile & TELECOMS ; News analysis ; Further M&A is on the cards , write Robert Budden , Anousha Sakoui and Paul Taylor A huge cash windfall from the sale of Vodafone 's stake in Verizon Wireless is far from certain . As the third-largest merger and acquisition deal in history looks set for completion , some analysts are predicting a bumper payout to shareholders of up to $70bn . But with the world 's second-largest mobile phone group contemplating further M&A , any cash payouts could be much less . In June , Vodafone agreed a EUR7.7bn takeover of Kabel Deutschland , its biggest deal since acquiring its Indian operations in 2007 , reflecting the belief of Vittorio Colao , the group 's chief executive , that bundled deals of internet and telecoms connections will help it win customers , buoy profit margins and increase customer loyalty . According to people close to the Verizon sale talks , Vodafone has appetite to conduct similar deals in markets such as Spain , Italy and Holland and would have been unlikely to have engaged in talks over the sale of its 45 per cent stake in the US wireless operator without a future M&A strategy in place . Following an agreed sale , Vodafone could make an offer for Ono , the Spanish cable operator , or Swisscom 's Fastweb in Italy , some analysts believe . Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate these deals would cost Vodafone about EUR7bn and EUR2bn , respectively . Having bought Cable & Wireless Worldwide in the UK in 2012 , Vodafone has also been linked with Ziggo , the Dutch cable operator , which has a market capitalisation of EUR6bn . An array of such deals would accelerate Vodafone 's convergence strategy . But they would still enable it to make a significant payout to shareholders and would have only minimal impact in making it less vulnerable to predators . Most notable among these is AT&T , which has a strong interest in Vodafone 's sizeable wireless presence in Europe , according to people close to the US telecoms company . The Dallas-based company sees big potential in mobile data services such as home automation and connected car navigation and entertainment systems as 4G is rolled out across the continent . AT&T has made it clear that it is interested in entering the European mobile market even though it views it as over regulated and recognises that there may be limited opportunities to expand penetration . However , it has little interest in Vodafone 's expanding portfolio of fixed line and cable assets . Analysts believe these would be attractive to John Malone 's Liberty Global , which already has a substantial portfolio of European cable assets . Yet there is one deal that would dramatically accelerate Vodafone 's convergence strategy and make it less appetising to predators : an acquisition of Liberty Global . On the day Vodafone confirmed its talks with Verizon , shares in Liberty Global spiked 3.3 per cent . Vodafone has also recently held discussions with Liberty Global about buying some of its cable assets in central Europe including UPC in Romania , the country 's second largest cable TV operator . Liberty Global , which has net debt of about $40bn and a market capitalisation of more than $30bn , would be a digestible deal for Vodafone post a Verizon stake sale and one which would significantly decrease its appeal as a takeover target , analysts said . People close to Liberty Global have said they are watching the Vodafone / Verizon talks with interest . Despite this , many analysts believe Vodafone will steer clear of such big deals - although they see smaller bolt-ons such as Italy 's Fastweb as more likely . Sticking only to smaller acquisitions would leave Vodafone free to make sizeable payouts to shareholders . Analysts at JPMorgan predict Vodafone could pay out $20bn upfront and , over time , around half of all Verizon sale proceeds to investors . But with analysts at the New York-based bank valuing the rump of Vodafone at pound(s)62bn after a Verizon sale , the group remains vulnerable to a takeover . Analysts believe Vodafone has to establish whether it is an acquirer or target .

Analysts voiced fears about the vulnerability of Vodafone 's UK business and Telefonica 's O2 subsidiary after the publication of plans for a joint venture between France Telecom 's Orange UK and Deutsche Telekom 's T-Mobile UK . If approved by regulators , the merger would create Britain 's largest mobile operator . Orange UK and T-Mobile UK at present lag behind O2 and Vodafone . Analysts also raised concerns about the potential for clashes between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom inside their UK "" mobile champion "" . Timotheus Hottges , Deutsche Telekom 's finance director , sought to allay fears that the Franco-German plans were destined to fail . He said that he and Gervais Pellissier , France Telecom 's finance director , were "" paranoid on problems "" and had devised mechanisms to resolve any disputes in the joint venture . France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are committed to their 50:50 joint venture for three years , after which one could buy the other out . The German government owns 32 per cent of Deutsche Telekom , and a senior official in Berlin said it was worried France Telecom might try to seize control of the merged entity . Nick Delfas , analyst at Morgan Stanley , said the merger plans left Vodafone 's UK business in a "" relatively poor market share position "" . Vodafone and O2 declined to comment . France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom want to secure regulatory approval by July . The merged entity is supposed to be accretive to earnings from 2011 . Given Orange UK is bigger than T-Mobile UK , France Telecom plans to place pound(s)1.25bn of its debt in the new entity . T-Mobile UK would go into the joint venture on a debt-free basis .

19-04-2012,461,"Jury out on Tesco blueprint for UK revival food & drug retailers ; News analysis ; Investors are sceptical about the potential for recovery , writes Andrea Felsted It was Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke 's second big day of the year . The first was in January when he delivered the group 's first profit warning in 20 years , wiping pound(s)5bn off its market capitalisation . Yesterday was the day Mr Clarke set out his plan to improve Tesco 's UK business , which still accounts for two-thirds of the group 's sales and profits , after the worst trading performance for decades . The announcement did not go as well as he might have hoped . There was no second profit warning , but Tesco managed to mess up the announcement of its dividend - confusing the total with the final dividend - a lack of professionalism that it is difficult to imagine occurring under former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy . Investors and analysts remain concerned as to whether the actions set out will be enough to revive Tesco 's performance in the UK , where many customers have fallen out of love with it and rivals are snapping at its heels . "" They are pointing at the right areas . You have got to be pretty sceptical that it is enough , "" said one big shareholder . Another investor said : "" They are again underestimating the scale of the problem and overestimating their abilities . "" Mr Clarke outlined a pound(s)1bn investment plan for the UK business , mainly to be funded from cash flow . In the UK , trading profit , which excludes profits from property and exceptional items , fell 1 per cent to pound(s)2.48bn in the year to February 25 , compared with the same period a year previously , and sales from stores open at least a year fell 1.2 per cent in the second half compared with the year earlier . He insisted that Tesco was "" not struggling "" , despite the decline in profit in the UK . "" We are successful , and we are strong , and my priority has been to safeguard that success by setting us on a course for sustained growth long into the future , "" he said . The group reported total sales up 7.4 per cent to pound(s)72bn , with pre-tax profit up 5.3 per cent to pound(s)3.8bn. The final dividend was 10.13p , taking the total from 14.46p to 14.76p. Mr Clarke 's plans include spending pound(s)200m putting more staff in stores and recruiting 8,000 new staff . Tesco will invest another pound(s)200m to revamp 430 supermarkets this year , in an attempt to make them feel warmer , and to put the "" heart and soul back into Tesco "" . Another pound(s)350m will go into cutting prices , although some of this is part of the pound(s)500m investment in prices committed to last autumn . Some seasoned supermarket watchers were surprised that Mr Clarke had not announced a more aggressive price reduction policy . Tesco will also cut back the amount of new space it opens in the UK . While it will continue to open smaller convenience stores , it will limit the number of new stores of more than 50,000 sq ft. "" It 's a fundamental change , "" Mr Clarke said . "" We will open the same number of shops as last year , but they will be smaller and more food focused . "" Overall , the amount of new space Tesco opens this year will fall from 2.4m sq ft in 2011-12 to 1.5m sq ft this year . Instead , it plans to spend pound(s)200m on improving its online operations . "" The important thing is . . . we position this business for a new era , a digital era , "" said Mr Clarke . Tesco has increased the number of non-food product lines it sells via the internet , doubling it to 80,000 lines , and plans to increase it to 200,000 by Christmas . It will also increase the network of stores from which goods ordered online can be collected , to create what Mr Clarke describes as "" the delicious combination of clicks and bricks "" . Tesco also plans to ramp up pressure on Ocado , with more so-called virtual supermarkets to deliver online grocery orders in London , but also into Oxfordshire and the West Midlands . Mr Clarke insists the strategy is sufficient to reinvigorate Tesco 's UK performance . He can point to the 1.1 per cent improvement in like-for-like sales from the 200 stores Tesco has revamped so far , as well as the improvement in overall UK like-for-like sales in the final quarter . These fell 1.6 per cent , a lower rate of decline than the 2.3 per cent fall over Christmas and the new year . "" We think it is enough because we have spent about nine months working out the plan , "" he said . But he declined to put any firm timeframe , or targets on the outcome . Some investors and analysts were unconvinced by the plans . Dave McCarthy , analyst at Investec Securities , and a long-term critic of Tesco said : "" There are no green shoots of recovery . Management has planted some seeds . We do n't know if they will take . We do n't know if they are the right seeds , or what their potential is . "" Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , described the plan as "" sensible overall , measured , and reasonably considered . But the proof of the pudding is in the eating "" .

13-09-2013,463,"Kabel investors approve EUR7.7bn Vodafone takeover The EUR7.7bn takeover of Kabel Deutschland by Vodafone won shareholder approval when votes in favour of the deal passed a crucial 75 per cent hurdle last night . The lengthy process of collecting and verifying votes meant uncertainty had persisted over whether the deal would be approved . People with knowledge of the transaction said the key threshold was reached late yesterday afternoon . There was nervousness among shareholders ahead of the vote given the relatively high threshold , even if there were none who had voiced opposition . Vodafone will reveal the final vote tally on Monday but said last night that the 75 per cent minimum acceptance condition had been met . The deal is a key strategic move in Vodafone 's ambition to create a multiple-service telecoms and cable business in the largest European markets . Kabel will add additional media services for Vodafone to sell to its customers alongside mobile calls , while its extensive fixed line network will make it cheaper to carry calls . Vodafone is in line for a huge payout once the $130bn deal to sell its stake in Verizon Wireless completes early next year . Part of this will be used to cover the acquisition of Kabel , although Vodafone will still be left with a large war chest for more acquisitions . Companies linked with Vodafone include Fastweb in Italy and Ono in Spain .

Concerns about the effectiveness of Europe 's future rescue fund led to Goldman Sachs to advise taking profits on the banks in the wake of last week 's rally in share prices from two-year lows . "" Doubts have started to creep back into the market , said Peter Oppenheimer , Goldman 's chief strategist .

Spirent Communications , the maker of network testing equipment , dropped 6.2 per cent to 126 3/4 p after profit warnings from Juniper Networks and Tellabs . The latter company , a competitor of Spirent , said it was cutting 10 per cent of its workforce after North American demand slumped by 46 per cent .

13-08-2009,469,"Luck and oil boost BHP 's balance sheet News analysis ; If hostile bid for rival had succeeded , the situation might be very different , writes William MacNamara Investors in mining companies have this year grown accustomed to looking ahead and hoping for the best , as the commodities sell-off has caused profits to evaporate . But BHP Billiton , the world 's largest miner , pleased investors yesterday by delivering a final dividend of 41 cents a share , giving a total of 82 cents for the year to June 30 . BHP is looking increasingly able to handle the disastrous market conditions , more so than rivals such as Anglo American or Xstrata , which have suspended their dividends until further notice as they struggle with high debt levels . The source of BHP 's strength is its balance sheet . Net debt of $5.59bn compares with $11.3bn at Anglo , for example . BHP 's relative strength is largely an accident of fortune . If it had succeeded in its hostile bid for rival Rio Tinto last year , the situation might now be very different . BHP would be saddled with extraordinarily high debt levels , including the $40bn of Rio 's Alcan-related debt that sent its competitor on a fundraising spree this year . The benefits of BHP 's size and diversification are also apparent . Alone among its UK mining peers , BHP has a petroleum division , whose operating profits of $4bn made it the group 's third most valuable division during the year after iron ore , which had operating profits of $6.23bn , and base metals with $4.62bn. The oil business alone almost offset net impairment charges totalling $4.84bn , including a $2.53bn charge incurred by closing down its Ravensthorpe nickel operation in Australia . Charles Kernot , analyst at Evolution , said oil was "" the key differentiating factor compared to BHP 's competitors , which do not have this positive exposure and , in fact , have negative exposure because of all their equipment requiring oil "" . It was a testament to the worst year in the mining sector 's living memory that BHP 's annual profits , which on a pre-tax basis fell 50 per cent to $11.6bn , were hailed by analysts as a solid , expectation-beating performance . Group revenue fell 16 per cent to just over $50bn . In the six months to June 30 , Anglo and Xstrata both recorded pre-tax profits plunging by close to 70 per cent year-on-year . In that period BHP 's profits of $4.72bn were 67 per cent lower than $14.3bn in the six months to June 2008 . Earnings per share fell 65 per cent to 58 cents on this basis . With the strongest balance sheet in the business BHP is rumoured to be chasing acquisitions , especially in potash and oil . Marius Kloppers , chief executive , confirmed yesterday the company had greater financial flexibility than any of its competitors to pursue "" just about any acquisition opportunity "" . But he cautioned that the company already had so much on its hands that it would narrowly pursue "" tier-one "" targets , meaning those rare assets - like Rio 's iron ore operations in Western Australia - that are high quality , low cost and have a long production life . Including the $5.8bn that BHP plans to invest in its Pilbara iron ore joint venture in Western Australia with Rio Tinto , Mr Kloppers said the miner had $17bn-worth of capital spending "" spoken for "" in the next 12 months , underlying the option it has to grow simply by developing its own asset portfolio . The company 's resilience will be tested in the current six-month period , perhaps more seriously than the half year just completed . Commodity markets are somewhat encouraging but still hard to read , the company said in a market outlook statement that was widely watched because of the company 's global influence . The process of re-stocking resources in China appears complete , BHP said . If that causes commodities demand to taper off , the slack might be picked up by nascent re-stocking process in the US and western Europe . Mr Kloppers said : "" China and India are doing very well , "" adding the rest of the world had "" stabilised "" even if at historically low levels of consumption . But Mr Kernot warned that , due to BHP 's size and scale , it will have to work very hard to outperform more agile peers . Credit : By William MacNamara",luck and oil boost bhp's balance sheet
9-02-2007,471,"Markham set to retire from Unilever FOOD PRODUCERS Rudy Markham is to retire as chief financial officer at Unilever , continuing a series of high-profile board changes at the Anglo- Dutch consumer goods group that reported disappointing sales figures with its annual results . Mr Markham , 60 , is to leave at the group 's annual meeting in May , when Michael Treschow , chairman of Swedish companies Ericsson and Electrolux and nicknamed Mike the Knife , will replace Antony Burgmans as chairman . Unilever also plans to appoint three new non-executive board members to increase diversity : Genevieve Berger , a French professor of biophysics and medical imaging ; Narayana Murthy , co-founder and chairman of India 's Infosys Technologies ; and Hixonia Nyasulu , a non- executive director of South Africa 's Sasol and Anglo Platinum . Patrick Cescau , Unilever 's chief executive , has expressed frustration at the difficulties involved in changing the culture and behaviour of people at Unilever , many of whom have spent their whole careers with the group . Investors , however , were pleased to see further management changes . They have been unhappy with the slow pace of change at Unilever , which has not been able to match the sales growth of competitors such as Reckitt Benckiser and Nestle . Mr Markham was not popular with shareholders , one of whom said : "" Shareholders did not enjoy communicating with him . He seemed to reflect much that was wrong at Unilever . "" Unilever reported underlying sales growth of 3.8 per cent for the full year . This was in line with the group 's projected range of 3 to 5 per cent , but lower than the 4 per cent analysts desired . Annual pre-tax profits rose 7 per cent to Euros 4.8bn ( Pounds 3.2bn ) . Profit margins were relatively weak at 13.6 per cent for the full year and 10.9 per cent for the fourth quarter . Mr Cescau said : "" To be frank , we 'd hoped to do better . "" Shares in Unilever fell 34p to Pounds 13.89. The company said a Euros 600m increase in costs of commodities such as soya , rapeseed , sunflower oil and tea hurt profitability from such products as Hellman 's mayonnaise and Lipton Tea . The rise was indirectly linked to biofuels , which are made from raw materials such as rapeseed and corn . Further increases in commodity costs are expected this year . A final dividend of 32.04p ( 30.09p ) is proposed , making a total of 47.66p ( 45.13p ) .",markham set to retire from unilever food producers
21-04-2012,473,"Misfortunes aside , Tesco chief is no Lemony Snicket It 's been a series of unfortunate events at Tesco since Sir Terry Leahy left about a year ago . In January his replacement as chief executive , Phil Clarke , delivered the supermarket chain 's first profit warning in 20 years . Sales over Christmas and the New Year were unusually bad and Mr Clarke 's Big Price Drop initiative failed to bring in the punters . Since then , the market has been eagerly awaiting Mr Clarke 's turnround strategy , which he unveiled on Wednesday with Tesco 's results for last year . The announcement , unfortunately , was botched . Tesco managed to confuse its dividend numbers and had to issue a correction a few hours later . It 's difficult to imagine such bungling under the eagle-eyed Sir Terry . But it was n't just the dividend mix-up that left investors unimpressed . The rest of Mr Clarke 's grand plan was also met with scepticism . There was no second profit warning . But Tesco 's performance in the UK , where it makes two-thirds of its sales , is still sluggish . And its ill-starred American foray is doing even worse than the UK operations . Mr Clarke pushed back the date when he expected the Fresh & Easy US business to break even to a year , or even two , from now . Fresh & Easy is estimated to have lost more than pound(s)700m since its launch in 2007 , and cost pound(s)1bn of investment . Fortunately , there were signs that Mr Clarke realises he ca n't keep squandering shareholders ' money on wasteful ventures . In recent years Tesco has allocated about as much to capital expenditure as it has made in operating profit - but without delivering the sales bang to justify the bucks spent . Mr Clarke now says he will spend less on opening new stores in the UK and the US , and more on revamping existing shops . Analysts and investors nevertheless reacted with caution to Mr Clarke 's plan . Not enough money , they fret , is to be spent cutting prices . And Mr Clarke 's record on spicing up Tesco 's stores is not , so far , terribly convincing . And he did n't set any timetable for when his plan would show results . Yesterday credit rating agency Moody 's downgraded Tesco 's credit rating by one notch . But the gloom over Tesco 's performance since Sir Terry left is exaggerated . True , the share price has fallen by a fifth since he quit the building - and it rose on average 9.3 per cent a year during his tenure . But the numbers simply do not support the idea that the supermarket chain is in serious trouble . Tesco 's pre-tax profit last year rose more than 5 per cent and its operating margin went up as well . Its revenues increased by more than 7 per cent . Most importantly , perhaps , for investors , despite recent travails , Tesco 's dividend also went up as well . The dividend yield on its shares is a tasty 5.1 per cent - whilst the FTSE 100 is only yielding 3.6 per cent . Tesco will fund most of its turnround plan from the cash it generates - more than pound(s)4bn last year . Investors should give Mr Clarke 's luck a chance to turn .","misfortunes aside, tesco chief is no lemony snicket"
21-01-2012,475,"Moody 's puts Tesco under review after profit warning Credit rating Moody 's , the credit rating agency , has placed Tesco 's A3 long-term senior unsecured rating under review for possible downgrade , following the retailer 's shock profit warning last week . Moody 's said yesterday that the review followed Tesco 's weak performance in its home market over the crucial Christmas and new year trading period , and the warning that underlying profits in the 2012-13 financial year would be lower than expected . "" The company 's recent investment in price promotions has not had the anticipated impact on volume growth . "" More significantly , however , Moody 's believes that the company 's revised forecast for profit growth suggests that the credit metrics may not improve to the extent that had previously been expected for the A3 rating and stable outlook , "" the rating agency said yesterday . However , it said that , more positively , Tesco had not altered its year-end net debt forecast of pound(s)6.4bn , while capital expenditure could be lowered through Tesco curbing its expansion plans , primarily through out of town hypermarkets . Last week , Tesco issued its first profit warning for 20 years after poor trading in its domestic market . However , it was given a fillip on Thursday when Warren Buffett , the billionaire US investor , spent pound(s)500m raising his stake in the retailer to more than 5 per cent .

5-12-2008,477,"Morrison steals a march on rival Tesco FOOD & DRUG RETAILERS ; Total third-quarter sales rise 14.9 % ; Chain performing well in London Wm Morrison cemented its position as the fastest growing of the listed supermarkets with a third-quarter trading update that left rivals in the shade . The grocery chain recorded like-for-like sales growth of 8.1 per cent , excluding petrol , and announced it would buy 38 stores from the Co-operative Group as it invested in expansion . The trading update , which beat analysts ' expectations , followed an anaemic performance by Tesco , the UK 's biggest retailer , which this week reported 2 per cent like-for-like sales growth during its third quarter and gambled on winning over cash-strapped customers with its "" discount brands "" strategy . Describing Tesco as "" the world 's best retailer "" , Marc Bolland , chief executive of Morrison , nonetheless noted that he was "" enjoying the challenge "" . "" Once again we have grown our like-for-like sales well ahead of the market , "" he said . "" We are continuing to do particularly well in London , the south and Scotland . . . We do n't always take customers in from Tesco ; we gain customers from all our major competitors . "" Morrison 's total sales in the 13 weeks to November 2 rose 14.9 per cent , or 9.5 per cent excluding fuel . Tesco has said that its numbers were dragged down by the decision to introduce cheaper brands , although that strategy would prevail in the medium term . "" We are following carefully what happens at Tesco , "" said Mr Bolland . "" Our own price offer is so strong . . . we would not do [ something similar ] now . "" Morrison said that its numbers still contained some inflation but that most of the increase came from new customers and that inflation had peaked . The UK 's fourth-largest supermarket group , Morrison said it was buying 38 stores from the Co-op for pound(s)223m , plus costs of pound(s)98m . Along with the acquisition of a distribution centre , Morrison is to spend pound(s)403m . John Kershaw , analyst at Merrill Lynch , said the transaction showed "" Morrison 's ambition but at a price "" . He reckoned the deal , which involves smaller stores than the average Morrisons supermarket , "" only just covers its weighted average cost of capital "" . The move is the first big expansion by Morrison since it acquired Safeway in 2004 , a deal that took longer than expected to integrate successfully . The Co-op deal would be earnings enhancing in the 2010-11 financial year , the company said . Morrison added it would now curtail its planned share buy-back to finance the pound(s)403m of investments . Shares in Morrison fell 5 3/4 p to close at 244 3/4 p.

16-01-2008,481,"Overseas sales cushion softer UK for Tesco By ELIZABETH RIGBY and MAGGIE URRY Tesco said yesterday it was feeling the effects of the consumer slowdown in its home market as Britain 's biggest retail chain failed to match up to sales expectations . Tesco said conditions had been more difficult over Christmas , but the 3.1 per cent lift in underlying sales - against expectations of 4-4.5 per cent - in the six weeks to January 5 was a credible effort . "" We had a good Christmas , "" said Andrew Higginson , finance director of the UK chain . "" We have been affected by the market the same as anyone else , as the market slows . Most people would give their right arm for these types of numbers . "" Mr Higginson said the overseas business - which stretches from the US to China - offered resilience against a softening in the UK . He said central Europe , where Christmas is widely celebrated , delivered a 30 per cent sales uplift . Overall the international business , which now accounts for nearly a quarter of group sales and a fifth of profits , enjoyed sales growth of 26.9 per cent . The IGD , the food research body , said yesterday that it expected Tesco 's international turnover to increase by Pounds 30bn ( Dollars 59bn ) to Pounds 74bn by 2012 . But it was the UK performance that captured the market 's attention yesterday as the shares dropped 3 per cent on the disappointing trading figures . Retail stocks have been some of the worst performers in the FTSE over the past two weeks as a glut of poor trading statements stokes wider concerns about the outlook for 2008 . Tesco said it still wanted to see a cut in UK interest rates and played down talk of food price inflation , saying that deflation in non-food items had offset any gains in food to keep inflation steady at 1 per cent . "" The consumer is under a lot of pressure . We think the Bank of England has misread the situation quite a bit over the past year , pushing rates up too fast , "" Mr Higginson said . He congratulated rival Wm Morrison , which looks set next week to be crowned the Christmas winner when it updates on its performance . He also said the newly opened Fresh & Easy chain of 28 stores in southern California , Las Vegas and Phoenix had seen a "" very encouraging "" response from shoppers : while the decision by Wal-Mart to open similar style shops in the area was "" the sincerest form of flattery "" .",overseas sales cushion softer uk for tesco

"" Permitting delays in the Gulf of Mexico continue to impact our petroleum operations , further deferring the drilling of high volume production wells , "" said BHP , whose financial year ends in June 2011 . "" We therefore expect production to be lower in the 2012 financial year . "" The lowered outlook for BHP Petroleum , which is trying to drill in deepwater areas of the gulf , follows BP 's disaster a year ago . The company also said it would spend less money than expected on oil exploration because of the delays facing its deepwater drilling programme . Copper production for the world 's biggest miner fell 9 per cent quarter on quarter , reflecting a sector-wide stagnation of the copper supply base despite high prices . The impact of flooding in Queensland , Australia was clear in lower production of coking coal , which fell to 6.7m tonnes from 7.8m in the prior quarter and 8.2m in same period last year . But the financial impact of marginally lower production in some commodities stands to be offset by high prices . RBC Capital Markets said it expects quarterly earnings per share for diversified miners to rise 6 per cent against the last quarter and 101 per cent against the same quarter last year . Freeport McMoran , the US-listed copper producer , on Tuesday set the tone for first-quarter earnings among metals miners . Freeport 's first-quarter net profits rose from $897m last year to $1.5bn.

Both BHP and Freeport saw copper production fall by more than 5 per cent in the latest quarter compared with the prior one . Freeport said on Tuesday it would add a 50 cent supplementary dividend to its 25 cent regular dividend , in the latest indication of the financial windfall it is distributing to shareholders . BHP appeared to maintain its momentum ahead of a June-end financial year that could be one of its most profitable on record .

19-06-2006,487,"Philanthropic project set up to battle ignorance Barclays is putting its money and its staff behind its efforts When in May the UK government published its long-awaited white paper on the state pension scheme , commentators emerged to debate the relative merits of the changes . Many of the details , however , will be lost on a large number of people , for whom finance and money management remain difficult to grasp . With this in mind , Barclays , the UK bank , this month announced the launch of a Pounds 3.6m scheme designed to foster financial literacy and help older people and disadvantaged families make the most of their income . The scheme , which is part of the bank 's corporate responsibility programme , involves funding to two charities - Help the Aged and NCH , the children 's charity - of Pounds 1.8m each to promote sound financial management and offer debt advice . In addition , through a large-scale volunteering campaign Barclays hopes that as many as 3,500 staff will work with the charities to provide advice on money management and general training on personal finance . For Barclays , the scheme is part of broader efforts to promote financial inclusion ( the bank even has a head of financial inclusion ) that make up a large chunk of its corporate responsibility activities . "" We try to orientate our community investment to things that have a good strategic link with banking , "" says Alastair Camp , head of corporate responsibility at Barclays . "" And this very much seen in terms of targeted philanthropy . "" In addressing financial inclusion , Barclays is part of a growing number of organisations , in both the public and private sector , working to increase knowledge of finance and economics among ordinary people as personal debt mounts , governments scale back their state benefits and fewer people can rely on their employer to guarantee financial security after they retire . As part of its Financial Education Project , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is studying financial education programmes in member countries and selected non-member countries . The idea is that by analysing the effectiveness of these progammes , it will develop a method that policymakers can use to improve financial literacy . In the UK , the government has earmarked Pounds 120m over three years for a Financial Inclusion Fund . The fund will support initiatives such as the provision of face-to-face money advice , the promotion of services for people who do not normally go to see debt advisers and the stimulation of demand for mainstream financial services . The government also wants to encourage banks to continue to make it easier for consumers to open a bank account . Mr Camp sees financial training as a vital tool in such efforts . "" There are a lot of people of all ages whose financial literacy is not necessarily as strong as they would wish and for older people as well it is certainly an issue , "" he says . "" A lot of people get confused by the funding of pensions and it 's something they 're more and more worried about . "" Barclays hopes that its scheme can help erode some of this confusion . When it comes to financial training for older people , Barclay 's volunteers will go to local Help The Aged centres around the country to provide everything from basic awareness raising to broader financial advice as well as information on understanding the chip-and-pin system and other forms banking . "" After these awareness-raising sessions , if it gives rise to an issue where financial advice is required on a one-to-one basis , then with Help The Aged we 'll be volunteering with help to open a bank account or do basic budgeting , "" says Mr Camp . With an average of two projects in each of Barclays ' nine regions , a total of 18 projects will be rolled out across the UK , each of which will employ an adviser and will recruit volunteers to support the service . At the same time , the bank is providing funding for Senior Line , a free telephone service run by Help The Aged that provides information and advice for older people with problems associated with their benefits and pensions . Working with NCH , Barclays also aims to help up to 140,000 low- income families , young people and those with mild learning disabilities improve their money management skills and achieving financial stability . The Barclays programme will run over three years and , during that period , the bank hopes to be able to help about 30,000 people directly through sessions at Help the Aged centres , and another 100,000 through the Senior Line . "" It 's certainly not a quick fix , "" says Mr Camp . "" This is an issue that 's going to be around for as long as you can look ahead .

Michael Helsby and Chris Roberts , analysts , reiterated a "" buy "" rating on the stock , citing stronger earnings numbers from US banks . They said the trend left their existing outlook for Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm , looking "" pessimistic "" and concluded that the first-quarter trading update due out on April 26 , "" could refocus investors to the fundamental attractions of Barclays "" .

Royal Bank of Scotland rose 3.8 per cent to 25.2p and Lloyds Banking Group was 4.2 per cent stronger at 31p . HSBC was 2.4 per cent higher at 554.1p. The rally was also encouraged by well-received results from a Spanish short-term debt auction , although a sterner test comes tomorrow when Madrid returns to the capital markets for a 10-year denominated debt sale . Nonetheless , it all helped offer some relief to Man Group , the hedge fund manager , which was able to join the recovery after string of negative broker comment issued ahead of its first-quarter results due on May 1 .

Overall , the FTSE 100 was 1.8 per cent higher at 5,766.95 , a rise of 100.67 points , supported by a strong start to Wall Street trading .

6-11-2009,493,"Price deflation takes shine off Unilever Unilever 's chief executive warned of a protracted global economic recovery and price deflation as the maker of Lipton tea and Sunsilk shampoo reported strong third-quarter results . Paul Polman has won the confidence of investors and analysts this year by delivering steady sales and volume growth , leading to a 36 per cent rise in Unilever 's share price over the past six months - more than double the rise in the FTSE 100 index . Yesterday , Mr Polman said his changes , which include turning round underperforming brands and stepping up the pace of innovation , were making a difference as the company beat expectat ions wi th underlying sales growth of 3.4 per cent and volume growth of 3.6 per cent . James Edwardes Jones , analyst at Execution , said : "" Excellent third-quarter results indicate Unilever is doing what it said it would do . "" Analysts were heartened to see that volume and sales growth , which was delivered in all regions , was not achieved by cutbacks in marketing spending . Unilever increased spending on advertising and promotions by 130 basis points . However , the shares fell 35p to pound(s)17.94 after the company said it had been reducing prices , particularly on spreads and homecare products . Mr Polman cautioned further declines in pricing in the fourth quarter would "" take a bit of the shine off our organic growth "" . Jim Lawrence , chief financial officer , said underlying prices would rise just 1.5 per cent in the full year ( compared with a 7.2 per cent increase last year ) , with prices falling between 2 and 3 per cent in the fourth quarter . Mr Polman also warned of sluggish market conditions . "" Employment and consumer confidence are the key drivers of long-term market growth and , unfortunately , unemployment continues to increase in many places and consumer confidence is still low .

21-09-2005,497,"Prosperous Tesco takes retailing to a new level With sales up 6.6 per cent , Sir Terry Leahy is still seeking business . Elizabeth Rigby reports For most British supermarkets , the pursuit of market share has an air of desperation about it . J Sainsbury is sending its staff on Jamie Oliver taste tests , banning e-mails and internal meetings for part of the week , and launching a new slogan ( Try Something New Today ) . Asda , like Sainsbury , is cutting prices . But although owned by Wal-Mart of the US and so not listed in London , it is also complaining to the Financial Services Authority about Goldman Sachs research that barely a single one of its customers will read because it claims Tesco is cheaper . And Wm Morrison , which is still struggling to absorb its Pounds 3.3bn acquisition of Safeway , is worried about simply getting food on to its shelves as it fights a strike threat from distribution workers . Yet , soaring prosperously above all this is Tesco . Yesterday , it reported a near-19 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits and a 6.7 per cent rise in underlying sales in the 24 weeks to August 13 , with second-quarter sales up 6.6 per cent . It is miles ahead of the pack , with a 30.5 per cent share of supermarket spending . Asda , its nearest competitor , lags with a 16.7 per cent share . And Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , thinks there is plenty more market to go for . First , Tesco is adding more space , with 600,000 sq ft opened in the first half , helping Tesco lift total sales 11.1 per cent to Pounds 14.6bn. "" As a rule of thumb , 6 per cent of new space produces sales growth of 3 per cent , "" says Sir Terry . He is also planning to add a further 1.23m sq ft earmarked for the second half . Second is the story of non-food . Dodging the 30.5 per cent market share figure , Sir Terry - as usual - points out that Tesco has just a 13.5 per cent market share of total UK retail sales . Tesco has gone into furniture and digital cameras in recent months . It is also opening a stand-alone non-food store in Manchester this autumn . Third , is the retailer 's internet reach . Tesco thinks there is lots of potential to expand the operation , which lifted sales by 31 per cent to Pounds 401m in the first half . However , non-food sales make up less than 10 per cent of Tesco.com 's turnover , against 20 per cent in the UK business overall . Sir Terry says Tesco may invest in building its own supply chain to broaden the range of products - such as clothes - available online . It could become key to the way in which Tesco brings its full non-food offer to a much wider audience , given that only 12 per cent of the population live within reach of the retailer 's biggest hypermarkets . But , there are potential clouds on the Tesco horizon . Sir Terry says he worries about the impact rising oil prices are having on consumer confidence . Meanwhile , the market-share gains Tesco has made come , in part , from the weakness of its three main rivals . And those gains could become harder to come by if the other three supermarket groups pull their socks up and start fighting back . One analyst estimates that between 2 and 3 per cent of Tesco 's underlying sales growth since July 2004 - including petrol where sales have been up more than 8 per cent - has come on the back of competitor weakness , given that Tesco 's typical underlying growth sits in the region of 5 to 6 per cent . Sir Terry admits that Tesco has been "" helped a bit with problems of competitors "" , but the defensive chief executive also notes that Sainsbury seems to be ironing out some of its problems with availability . But whether a revival among the likes of Asda and Sainsbury - Morrison still has a long way to go to put its house in order - can really dent Tesco is questionable given the market lead it now has , coupled with a sizeable land bank , which locks in its growth . Meanwhile , if Tesco is feeling the effects of cost pressures on a profit of Pounds 908m , it will certainly be taking its toll on Morrison and Sainsbury , with the former heading for a heavy loss this year , while the latter only scraped a profit in the year to May . "" It is a bit like shooting at a tank with a pea shooter , "" observes one analyst . "" At least two of the three have to start flying to put a dent into ( Tesco 's ) sales expectations . ""","prosperous tesco takes retailing to a new level with sales up 6.6 per cent, sir terry leahy is still"
3-02-2009,499,"Ratings cut ends rally by Barclays BANKS ; Moody 's move signals losses fear ; ' Significant ' further writedowns possible Barclays ' share price fell and the cost of insuring its debt against default rose yesterday after Moody 's , the rating agency , cut the bank 's credit ratings and raised the prospect of heavy future losses on complex debt securities . The downgrade ended the rally in Barclays ' shares , which doubled in value last week after its chairman and chief executive took the unusual step of publishing an open letter to shareholders reassuring them about the bank 's 2008 results . Lowering Barclays ' credit rating by two notches to Aa3 from Aa1 , Moody 's signalled that continued turmoil in financial markets could lead to "" significant further writedowns on the bank 's credit market exposures "" . Moody 's noted the bank 's pound(s)10.3bn commercial mortgage portfolio and its pound(s)23bn portfolio of securities , which are insured by monoline credit insurers . Moody 's said losses on lending to corporations and consumers in the UK were likely to rise because of the economic downturn . Last month Moody 's cut Royal Bank of Scotland 's ratings by the same amount . Barclays ' downgrade is a setback in its efforts to persuade investors that it has weathered the credit market storms better than rivals . Many investors remain sceptical about the valuation of assets on Barclays ' balance sheet , and say it will eventually have to recognise losses that other banks have already absorbed . In the open letter Marcus Agius , chairman , and John Varley , chief executive , signalled that Barclays had written off pound(s)8bn on complex debt instruments last year but that this was partly offset by hedges and accounting gains from the reduced value of the bank 's debt . Moody 's lowered its assessment of Barclays ' financial strength from B to C but acknowledged that , after twice raising capital last year , the bank could absorb pound(s)16bn-pound(s)17bn of losses without breaching regulatory capital limits . "" You could see losses of up to this level and , all other things being equal , it would n't have an impact on this rating , "" said Elisabeth Rudman , a vice-president and senior credit officer in Moody 's Financial Institutions Group . Shares in Barclays fell 11.8p , or more than 11 per cent , to close at 94.3p. The cost of insuring its debt against default rose 14.5 basis points to 187bp , meaning it costs pound(s)187,000 a year to insure pound(s)10m of Barclays bonds over five years .

28-10-2011,501,"Results lift Dow Chemical and BASF chemicals ; Rising raw material costs absorbed ; Groups caution over pockets of weakness Two of the world 's biggest manufacturers of chemicals reported solid results on Thursday as strong demand allowed them to pass on higher raw material costs to customers , but both cautioned about pockets of economic weakness . Dow Chemical , the US group , reported a surge in third-quarter profits and revenues thanks in part to demand , particularly in emerging markets , for agricultural chemicals and compounds used in aluminium and paper production . Meanwhile , BASF , the world 's biggest chemicals company , said sales rose 11.6 per cent to EUR17.6bn compared with the same period in 2010 , although disruptions to its Libyan oil operations dented profits . The German group struck a cautious tone about the outlook , however , noting that volatility in international capital markets had led some of its clients to delay orders and reduce their inventories . BASF cut its own forecasts for global economic growth in 2011 by about a percentage point to a range of 2.5-3 per cent . Kurt Bock , chief executive , said the company would continue its cost saving programmes . "" We remain cautious despite the current good performance as economic growth is likely to slow further , "" he said . "" Credit restrictions in China , as well as debt crises in Europe and the US will adversely impact growth . "" Dow gave a careful but slightly more upbeat outlook . Andrew Liveris , chief executive of Dow , noted "" ongoing volatility in the pace of global economic recovery , "" but said the company was prepared for "" jagged economic conditions over the near term "" . Mr Liveris said that Dow would be buoyed by its exposure to emerging markets and resilient sectors like agriculture and energy and added that cost-cutting measures and efforts to trim its working capital would boost cash flows by $750m next year . In the third quarter , net income at Dow doubled to about $900m compared with the same period in 2010 , giving earnings per share of $0.69 , despite a $1.7bn rise in the cost of raw materials . During the three months to the end of September , revenues jumped 17 per cent to $15.1bn , driven by strong sales in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region that offset declines in the US and Europe and allowed Dow to increase its prices by 17 per cent . In midday US trading , Dow shares rose 9 per cent to about $29.21. In Europe , BASF shares rose 8 per cent to EUR54.37 on Thursday .

18-11-2009,505,"Retail rents offset drop in office space demand as British Land looks to rebuild An improvement in retail rents offset a fall in demand for office space at British Land in the first half , as the property company that launched a pound(s)740m ( $1.24bn ) rights issue in February insisted it was back in acquisitive mode . Chris Grigg , chief executive , said yesterday that a fall in the number of retailers facing administration had helped boost net income from its retail portfolio by 2.7 per cent in the six months to September 30 , although a 2.3 per cent decline in office income reduced overall like-for-like rental income growth to 0.7 per cent over the period . The company , which last year wrote off more than pound(s)3bn from the value of its estate , saw its net asset value slide by 6.5 per cent over the six months . However , it said NAV had rebounded by 3.1 per cent in the second quarter amid encouraging lettings potential as "" a positive shift in investor appetite combined with limited stock "" benefited market valuations . The company , which is operating a portfolio valued at pound(s)8.3bn compared with pound(s)11.6bn a year ago , ended the six months with NAV per share of 372p , down from 398p at the beginning of the interim period . Mr Grigg said British Land , which last year made disposals as well as tapping shareholders for cash in a bid to pin back net debt to pound(s)4.8bn , was bidding actively for pound(s)500m of properties while another pound(s)2bn remained on its radar . A pound(s)1bn budget freed in September through the sale of a 50 per cent stake in the Broadgate development in London would be used to target better investment opportunities during the next two years , he said . "" When we see attractive opportunities to put in bids , we will - the highest proportion from the pound(s)500m [ under current bid ] is in retail , and about a quarter in offices , "" said Mr Grigg . But Mr Grigg insisted British Land would "" be patient and act in a disciplined manner "" as it rebuilt its portfolio . "" The refinancing overhang and the balance sheet exposures of the banks nonetheless remain structural issues , which will weigh on values over the medium term , "" he added . Brokers Evolution said British Land was now "" better placed than its peers for buying distressed or mispriced assets "" . Gross rental income for the six months fell from pound(s)283m to pound(s)240m and a sharp contraction in the impact of negative revaluations , down from pound(s)1.2bn to pound(s)188m , saw pre-tax losses pegged back from pound(s)1.33bn to pound(s)113m . British Land declared a second quarterly dividend of 6.5p , giving a first-half total of 13p ( 15.53p ) . This was uncovered by losses per share of 13p but backed by pound(s)129m of underlying profits , which generated underlying earnings per share of 15p .

Rio rose 6 per cent to Pounds 63.67 amid talk BHP would increase the exchange ratio of its bid to four BHP shares for every one Rio share . BHP , which rose 5.4 per cent to Pounds 18.65 , would then seek to get a recommendation from Rio before regulators in Europe start their investigation into the deal . This is due to commence later this month . Traders said such a move might help smooth the regulatory process . However , most reckoned a trigger - such as further Chinese stakebuilding in Rio - would be needed before BHP raised its offer . They also noted that any increase in the share exchange ratio above 3.7:1 would leave the majority of BHP shares trading in London rather than Australia . All told , it was good day for the mining sector as commodity prices such as copper came close to record highs . Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 13.40 while Antofagasta added 4 per cent to 798p . Lonmin , the platinum producer , added 5.4 per cent to Pounds 32.74 ahead of next week 's second-quarter production report . Traders noted that Lonmin had significantly underperformed peers Aquarius Platinum and South Africa 's Impala Platinum since the start of the year . However , Aquarius slipped 4.2 per cent to 814 1/2p after raising Dollars 366m through a placing of new shares at 800p .

The FTSE 250 rose 187 points , or 1.9 per cent , to 10,091.2. However , trading volumes were light , with just 2.5bn shares changing hands . Traders said this suggested that most of yesterday 's buying was done to close short positions . Indeed , this was particularly evident in the banking sector , where shares in Royal Bank of Scotland jumped 7.6 per cent to 375p , Barclays rose 6.7 per cent to 479p and Alliance & Leicester climbed 6.8 per cent to 503p .

Remaining on the speculative tack , drugmaker Shire firmed 0.4 per cent to 931p on renewed talk of a bid from Pfizer . Traders reckoned a bid from AstraZeneca , 0.7 per cent higher at Pounds 21.36 , was more likely now that it had settled a patent dispute over top-selling ulcer treatment Nexium . Of mid-caps , Findel , the home shopping and educational supplier group , gained 9.8 per cent to 444 1/4p after Kaupthing advised clients to buy .

4-02-2009,509,"Rise in full-year guidance boosts Vodafone shares mobile & telecoms ; Group ' resilient ' in downturn , says chief ; Businesses in Spain and Turkey suffer Vodafone reported deteriorating performances at its Spanish and Turkish businesses yesterday , but investors were cheered as the mobile phone operator raised its profit guidance for the full year . Sterling 's weakness against other currencies , chiefly the euro , has enabled the UK company to increase its operating profit guidance by pound(s)500m ( $720m ) to a range of pound(s)11.5bn-pound(s)12bn for 2008-09 . Vodafone has also inc-reased its free cash flow guidance by pound(s)300m to pound(s)5.5bn-pound(s)6bn , and the company 's shares closed up more than 7 per cent at pound(s)137.2. Vodafone generated revenue of pound(s)10.5bn in the three months to December 31 , up 14.3 per cent , largely because of favourable exchange rate movements . More than 60 per cent of Vodafone 's revenue is derived from the eurozone . On an underlying basis , revenue fell 1 per cent in the company 's third quarter , partly because Vodafone is selling fewer mobile phones in the economic downturn . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , reassured investors by outlining progress with his plans to cut costs by pound(s)1bn by 2010-11 . He said the mobile operator was showing resilience in the downturn , pointing to how some companies in other industry sectors were faring much worse . "" We are in a better place than others but not in a totally immune place , "" he said . Mr Colao , in contrast to his predecessors , is focusing on extracting better performances from Vodafone 's existing businesses rather than seeking more large acquisitions . Vodafone 's UK , Italian and German businesses recorded improving revenue trends in the third quarter . However , Vodafone 's Spanish business saw its revenue fall by 5.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2007-08 . The business is struggling with the recession in Spain , and its customer base has been skewed towards immigrants working in the construction sector , some of whom have lost their jobs . The picture was even worse at Vodafone 's Turkish business , where revenue fell by 14.5 per cent . Arun Sarin , Mr Colao 's predecessor , bought the business for $4.6bn in 2005 , but it has run into severe problems linked to its mobile network and sales outlets . Meanwhile , Vodafone saw slowing growth at some of its other businesses in emerging markets , including Egypt and India . A price war between Indian mobile operators means Vodafone reported lower revenue growth of 30 per cent in the third quarter . This compares with 50 per cent in the same period in 2007-08 . Sterling 's weakness is not just hitting Vodafone 's full-year guidance . Using exchange rates at January 30 would increase Vodafone 's net debt by pound(s)5.7bn to pound(s)33.5bn , because much of it is not denominated in sterling . However , Vodafone highlighted how the increase in net debt was more than offset by the rise in value of the company 's international assets . www.ft.com / lombard Credit : By Andrew Parker in London",rise in full-year guidance boosts vodafone shares

29-04-2011,513,"Rising costs eat into profit at Unilever Food producers Unilever shares dipped after the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods conglomerate said underlying sales in the developed world fell in the first quarter . The company also warned of a sharply higher commodities bill this year and depressed operating margins in the first half . Unilever , manufacturer of Dove shampoo and Magnum ice cream , said commodity cost inflation this year would equate to 500-550 basis points of turnover , up from the 400bp forecast three months ago . Offsetting the higher input bill , Unilever has accelerated its cost reductions and expects to save an additional EUR300m ( pound(s)267m ) on top of a stipulated EUR1bn . However , analysts said this still left a shortfall of EUR100m-EUR150m , at least some of which would need to be recovered through higher pricing . "" To meet even flat margins this year is going to be a challenge , "" said Martin Deboo , analyst at Investec . "" There is a big gap to be closed between costs and prices . "" Unilever , which only gave turnover numbers for the first quarter , said : "" The markets for our input materials remain volatile . . . leading to further upward pressure on prices . Price increases are lagging cost increases and [ this ] means we expect the movement in underlying operating margin to be down in the first half before improving in the second half of 2011 . "" Overall , underlying sales rose 4.3 per cent to EUR10.86bn , driven by emerging markets . In Asia , Africa and central and eastern Europe , which make up two-fifths of revenues , sales lifted 8.9 per cent year on year in the first quarter . Western European underlying sales fell 2.7 per cent , while prices stayed broadly flat , dragged down by southern Europe and weakness in Germany in savoury and spreads , a sector where overall volumes dropped . Unilever shares closed down 48p at pound(s)19.42. * FT Comment Unilever was lobbed an interesting question on the analysts ' call : could it split itself in two ? This was not just the old chestnut about separating food from household and personal care , but splitting emerging markets and the developed world . The two halves have broadly similar revenues , but when it comes to growth , developed markets are a drag . Yet the latter still throw off decent cash and could comfortably afford to pick up the odd acquisition . Meanwhile , the emerging markets unit could invest in capacity , ramp up marketing and still see its valuation soar . For evidence , look at Hindustan Unilever .

His latest tussle with Barclays , with which the club had an overdraft facility , left him spitting mad and savage in his criticism of the bank 's behaviour . Barclays was "" constantly trying to lends us money throughout my tenure , "" said Mr Lowe , who resigned as chairman of Southampton Leisure Holdings , the club 's parent company , on Thursday . At the end of his previous role as chairman , in July 2006 , SLH had a small surplus . He returned last May with SLH overdrawn by pound(s)1.3m on a facility of pound(s)5m . "" The bank was a salesman rather than a lender for a long period of time , "" said Mr Lowe , who is also chairman of broker WH Ireland and was formerly at Deutsche Bank . Mr Lowe said he set about cutting costs to bring the debt back into the facility , only to discover the bank deciding in November to cut the facility back to pound(s)4m . The crunch appears to have been the January transfer window . Hopes of player sales did not materialise and the club 's precarious position - next to bottom in the Championship - contributed to the bank 's loss of confidence . Barclays said the company 's "" reasonable "" goals of raising significantly club attendance , player sales , a general increase in income and the need to raise further investment had "" not been met "" , and that it would work with all parties to achieve them . Mr Lowe will not be among them . "" The directors did n't have sufficient amount of money to refinance the club personally "" , he said . "" I have never pretender to be a member of the uber-rich .

4-06-2009,519,"Sale of Barclays notes shows life in subordinates Strong demand for the biggest ever single sale of sterling bank debt yesterday was seen as the latest sign of banks ' ability to tap formerly closed markets as investors appear increasingly comfortable with paper they had until recently shunned . The pound(s)1.25bn ( $2.bn ) sale of Barclays subordinated notes attracted bids worth more than three times the amount on offer . The notes were held by the Abu Dhabi-owned International Petroleum Investment Company which also this week sold its pound(s)3.5bn investment in Barclays ' stock for a significant profit . "" This is a sign that the hybrid market is open . To get such a big sterling book is definitely good news and its clear that you can get deals done for institutions that people are comfortable with , "" said Richard Thomson at Henderson Global Investors . Last week , Rabobank , the Dutch institution , became the first European bank to issue fresh paper this year with a $1.5bn offering . The Barclays and Rabobank issues are subordinated debt that sit in a grey area between equity and straight debt . For banks , they count towards key regulatory measures of equity capital while investors have traditionally been attracted by the higher yields they offered . Investors cautioned that although the two recent deals show fresh appetite for the paper , banks interested in tapping that demand would have to pay heavily . Rabobank 's paper carried a coupon of 11 per cent while the Barclays note , first issued last November , pays interest of 14 per cent . Both deals also carry heavy penalties so that if either bank does not repay the paper at the first available date in 10-years ' time , they will face a steep step-up in their interest costs . Existing subordinated paper , which tends to carry far weaker repayment penalties , is still trading at a significant discount to its face value . Demand for the Barclays notes came from US and Asian investors as well as traditional sterling buyers . There had been fears that demand would not actually match the supply .

31-05-2006,521,"Sarin ' buys time ' with Pounds 9bn increase in Vodafone pay-out Leading Vodafone investors last night said Arun Sarin , chief executive , had bought himself more time after unveiling plans to give Pounds 9bn to shareholders on top of the UK mobile operator 's 2006 dividend . Investors welcomed Vodafone 's 2006 results but said Mr Sarin would be judged on execution of its strategy statement , which deals with the company 's deteriorating financial performance . Vodafone broke with its mobile-focused past by announcing plans to provide high-speed internet access over landlines under a "" Mobile Plus "" slogan . Vodafone reported a record pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.9bn for 2006 , and warned of slowing revenue growth , lower profit margins and reduced free cash flow in 2007 . But it increased its dividend pay-out ratio from 45 per cent of adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2005 to 60 per cent in 2006 and declared it the target for the future . Vodafone said it would return a further Pounds 9bn to investors in 2007 after selling its Japan business and increasing its borrowing . Vodafone saw core profit , based on its preferred measure of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , increase by 7 per cent to Pounds 11.8bn. The record pre-tax loss was caused primarily by a Pounds 23.5bn write-down of assets and resulted in a basic loss per share of 27.7p. Credit rating agencies downgraded Vodafone 's rating after the company said it was increasing borrowing , partly to return Pounds 3bn to shareholders in 2007 alongside Pounds 6bn derived from selling its Japan business . Vodafone 's shares , which rose to 124p during the day 's trading , closed unchanged at 119 3/4p . Some big shareholders who strongly criticised Mr Sarin after the company warned of slowing growth last November said the 2006 results might have taken the immediate pressure off him . "" He is buying time for himself , "" said a Vodafone top-10 investor . Standard Life , another top-10 shareholder , said the changes to Vodafone 's balance sheet structure were "" appropriate "" . "" However , we . . . remain sceptical on Vodafone 's ability to realise its earnings potential . "" Vodafone will start meeting its shareholders next week in preparation for July 's annual meeting . Standard Life said it would be "" considering our voting position very carefully "" .

Vodafone is braced for investors holding about 10 per cent of its shares to vote against Mr Sarin 's re-election at the company 's annual meeting today , but he insisted he had the right strategy to reverse slowing revenue growth . Standard Life Investments , one of Vodafone 's top 10 investors , said the stock market had "" lost confidence in Sarin 's judgment as a leader of Vodafone "" . Mr Sarin also suffered a setback when Vodafone announced that Bill Morrow , who was appointed head of its European operations in April with a mandate to cut costs and restore growth in its core markets , would depart by the end of the month "" for family reasons "" . Mr Sarin , who faces a protest against his re-election fromMorley Fund Management , Hermes Pension Management and Standard Life Investments , said yesterday : "" Over the years we have received strong support from the majority of our shareholders , and that is what we expect tomorrow . And I feel strong support from the board . "" Frankly , this is a time for us to kind of march on . . . I look forward to working with my team in . . . executing on the strategy we have discussed . "" He added that a "" silent super majority of shareholders "" were happy with Vodafone 's strategy , which partly focuses on getting customers to make greater use of their mobiles in homes and offices . Vodafone 's challenges in Europe were underlined yesterday with the publication of better than expected group revenue figures for the first quarter of its 2007 fiscal year . It reported revenue growth of 9.2 per cent against the first quarter of 2006 . But year- on-year revenue growth in Europe was 0.5 per cent , compared with 62.2 per cent in emerging markets . Vodafone added a total of 16.2m customers in the quarter , after acquisitions , taking the total to 186.8m. It stuck by its guidance of mobile revenue growth of 5-6.5 per cent for 2007 , compared with 9 per cent in 2006 . It expects its profit margins to be 1 per cent lower in 2007 . In May Vodafone reported a record pre-tax loss of Pounds 14.9bn for 2006 . Some of Vodafone 's investors were unnerved by Mr Morrow 's exit , partly because they regarded him as a potential successor to Mr Sarin .

28-05-2008,525,"Sarin sees growth for Vodafone in Africa and Asia as he heads for exit Mobile phone group 's chief to leave in July Arun Sarin yesterday sought to dispel fears about slowing revenue growth at Vodafone by saying the mobile phone company would make more acquisitions in Africa and Asia . Mr Sarin 's statement came as he announced that he planned to step down as chief executive in July from the world 's largest mobile operator by revenue , and that Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's deputy chief executive , would succeed him . Vodafone 's guidance implies revenue growth of 5.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in 2008-09 , down from 6.6 per cent in 2007-08 . The slowing growth trajectory from the UK company is due to the increasing maturity of some of its operations in emerging markets , such as those in eastern Europe , plus the likely impact of the economic downturn . Vodafone lifted overall revenue by 14.1 per cent to L35.5bn in the year to the end of March . From this , it made a pre-tax profit of L9bn , compared with a loss of L2.4bn in 2006-07 . Shares in Vodafone closed down almost 2 per cent at 160 1/2p . Mr Sarin acknowledged the challenges posed by the economic slowdown , saying it could affect Vodafone 's operations in Europe and emerging markets . But he was confident that Vodafone would do more deals in Africa and Asia . He brushed aside concerns that the company 's efforts to secure revenue from the mobile internet could be hit by new competitors such as Google and Nokia . "" We will get the Africa stuff done , we will get the Asia stuff done , we will get the internet stuff done , "" he said . Mr Sarin and Mr Colao alluded to more deals to boost Vodafone 's ability to provide internet services on mobiles . It was Vodafone 's warning of slowing growth and declining profit margins in 2005 that almost cost Mr Sarin his job the following year . He eventually won over investors to his strategy of buying mobile operations in emerging markets to counter slowing growth in Europe . Mr Sarin repeated Vodafone 's interest in securing control of Vodacom , South Africa 's largest mobile operator , which it jointly owns with Telkom , the country 's leading fixed-line business . He played down the prospect of Vodafone swapping its 3 per cent stake in China Mobile , the world 's largest mobile operator by market capitalisation , for a larger holding in another Chinese wireless business .

The timing depends on approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission , which Barclays hopes to receive this week after its results . But the SEC could require Barclays to postpone the buy- back until the offer for ABN closes or lapses , which could be October . The SEC has restrictions on companies buying back shares until an offer has been declared unconditional . ABN 's supervisory and executive boards are to meet on Friday to discuss the competing offers after dropping a recommendation for the Barclays bid while seeing how its shares performs . Barclays shares continued to rise yesterday by 3.5p to 738.5p , valuing its offer at about Euros 68.6bn , compared with the Euros 71.1bn offered by the rival consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland . Barclays on Monday unveiled strategic investors China Development Bank and Temasek as part of its revised offer . Some investors will be looking closely at Barclays ' partnership with the Chinese bank and its involvement in controversial projects , such asthe Three Gorges Dam project . Yesterday UK-based Co-operative Financial Services , which is known for ethical investing policies , said it did not have a problem with the investment although it added : "" We would want to ensure levels of corporate and social responsibilities which are the norm in the UK are not compromised in any way . "" In the coming days attention will switch to the rival RBS-led offer for ABN , with greater scrutiny of Belgo-Dutch lender Fortis , seen as the weak link in the RBS-led consortium . It must have its fundraising approved by shareholders at an EGM on August 6 . ABN had written to Sir Fred Goodwin , chief executive of RBS , raising concerns about a proposed split of the Netherlands wholesale bank between RBS and Fortis , which would take retail and small business customers . In a letter seen by the FT , Rijkman Groenink , ABN chief executive , claimed there was a Euros 234m pre-tax profit difference between the consortium 's and ABN 's figures . ABN said the operations were no longer split in this way and there were challenges in using the old WCS unit as a basis for dividing the business . In recent days , its concerns are thought to have reduced . The RBS-led consortium said in a statement : "" The consortium shareholder agreement provides a mechanism for reconciling any differences in the assumptions regarding wholesale customer allocation and any resulting value adjustment that may arise .

13-05-2008,529,"Shoppers ' positive ' on Tesco 's US stores By TOM BRAITHWAITE and ELIZABETH RIGBY Tesco 's ambitious attempt to break into the US grocery market with its Fresh & Easy convenience chain appears to be gaining traction with local shoppers , according to independent research seen by the Financial Times . Interviews with nearly 700 customers outside nine Fresh & Easy stores in Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Phoenix found a strong positive reaction to the chain . The interviews were carried out by Execution Research , a boutique research house with no corporate relationship with Tesco . "" Fresh & Easy is the new cult retailer , "" Execution wrote . "" At the risk of doing the job of Tesco 's public relations department , F&E is already an incredible success story . "" The research comes after speculation by journalists , bloggers and analysts that Tesco 's investment of Pounds 250m-a-year in the venture was failing to hit the mark with locals , resulting in low sales densities and few regular shoppers . The researchers found that customers who did visit Fresh & Easy liked what they saw . The chain was rated higher than Trader Joe 's and Whole Foods on freshness of product , and it even managed to beat Wal-Mart on value for money . Execution said that it expected shopper numbers - the stores they were monitoring had only 20-30 customers through the door every hour - to increase as the brand grew . Nearly nine in 10 shoppers said they would "" highly recommend "" the stores to friends and family - the highest recommendation score in 200 brand evaluations undertaken by the team . What is still unknown is how Fresh & Easy is performing financially . Tesco will not release detailed sales figures until the business , launched last November , is a bit older . However , it did reassure analysts in April that sales were above the industry average of Dollars 8.70 a square foot a week . It needs densities of Dollars 14-Dollars 21 to hit its return targets . The researchers estimated that sales densities in the stores sampled were running at Dollars 6-Dollars 12 , with some of the best stores already clocking up Dollars 20 . "" We estimate that within five years F&E will make sales of Dollars 12bn , "" it said .

Andrew Higginson , finance director , defended the 3.1 per cent rise in UK underlying sales as a good performance and rejected concerns that Britain 's shoppers were falling out of love with their biggest retail chain . "" We have all been affected by the market the same as anyone else as the market slows . Most people would give their right arm for these types of numbers , "" he said . But the wider sector fell on news that even Tesco was not immune to the slowdown . Home Retail Group and Kingfisher , which owns B&Q , were two of the top-three fallers in the FTSE as the general retail index fell 5 per cent . Tesco shares closed 3 per cent lower at 407p . Mr Higginson congratulated Wm Morrison , which looks set next week to be crowned the Christmas winner when it updates on its performance , saying the Bradford-based chain had been a formidable competitor , albeit from "" a low base "" . "" Wm Morrison got it right and fair dues to them , "" he said , adding that "" the rest of us were about the same "" . But underlying sales growth of 3.1 per cent in the six weeks to January 5 was less than the 4.1 per cent of Waitrose in a similar period . It was also below the 3.7 per cent growth for J . Sainsbury in the 12 weeks to December 29 . Mr Higginson said a comparison with Sainsbury was unfair since Tesco 's rival 's figure covered a longer period and , for the early part of it , Tesco had seen a 4 per cent sales gain . He said Sainsbury 's gross margins might have been affected by markdowns - something Justin King , its chief executive , has refuted . Mr Higginson said the group as a whole had lifted sales 12.8 per cent in the six weeks . The international business performed better than the UK , with sales over the festive season up 26.9 per cent . As well as strong growth in Europe and Asia , Tesco said its new chain of 28 stores in southern California , Las Vegas and Phoenix had received a "" very encouraging "" response from shoppers .

Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , on Thursday acknowledged that smaller European mobile operators may mount "" spoilers "" to the company 's strategy by offering cheap deals to smartphone customers . However , he expressed confidence that Vodafone 's new charging model for smartphone customers would succeed over the long term . Vodafone 's big bet for a new wave of growth is rooted in booming consumer demand for smartphones , led by Apple 's iPhone . It is planning to charge customers according to how much data they consume and what type of service they require . Business people needing fast e-mail access at any time of day could pay more than teenagers who are willing to download data only at night . Mr Colao said the new charging model "" will be conducive "" to increasing the average amount of revenue secured from its customers each month , so long as they consume more data over time . Asked about the possibility of smaller rivals unleashing a price war , he told a Morgan Stanley investor conference in Barcelona : "" Of course there could be spoilers here and there , but in the long run the economics of data are hard to be spoiled tactically .

Vodafone is among the two leading operators in three of its four core European markets . In the UK , it is the third-largest operator .

The protest against Mr Sarin is not expected to force his immediate departure , but it will intensify pressure on Sir John Bond , Vodafone 's incoming chairman , to decide quickly whether to find a new chief executive .

Investors holding a further 5 per cent of Vodafone 's shares could abstain , said these people . The protest against Mr Sarin is not expected to force his immediate departure , but it will intensify pressure on Sir John Bond , Vodafone 's incoming chairman , to decide quickly whether to find a new chief executive . Mr Sarin , meanwhile , will be under pressure to show rapid progress on Vodafone 's new strategy to deal with slowing revenue growth by cutting costs and getting customers to make greater use of mobiles in their homes . Standard Life Investments , one of Vodafone 's top 10 investors , is expected to vote against Mr Sarin 's re-election or abstain at tomorrow 's annual meeting in London . It declined to comment . People familiar with the thinking of Hermes Pension Management , another big investor , said it would vote against Mr Sarin 's re- election . Vodafone said : "" We respect the views of individual shareholders . As far as we are aware , the vast majority of votes cast support the board . "" Mr Sarin has come under fire from some of Vodafone 's big investors since the company warned last November of slowing revenue growth and lower profit margins .

But at BHP Billiton , where Chip Goodyear will pass the chief executive 's cap to Marius Kloppers in September , it looks as though the credit crunch never happened . No halt to the share buy-back programme ( on the contrary , the company says , this would be a good time to buy its own stock on the cheap ) , no let-up in demand from China and India , no problem in getting financing , should it be needed , for further expansion . BHP acknowledges that a spillover from financial crisis into the world economy would have an impact , but says emerging market growth is underpinned by domestic demand . The group has backed its bullish outlook with a rebased dividend a good 5 per cent higher than analysts had expected and nearly 50 per cent up on last year 's final pay-out . Perhaps the only downside of these results was that they provided more of a boost to rivals ' shares yesterday than to BHP itself . Still , with most analysts setting their 12-month share price targets at least Pounds 2 above yesterday 's closing level of Pounds 13.65 , that is barely a blip on the radar for Captain Kloppers .",steady as bhp goes andrew hill - lombard
25-02-2011,543,"Strong Asian and US sales help BASF to raise dividend by almost 30 % CHEMICALS BASF surprised investors with a dividend increase of almost 30 per cent after strong sales in Asia and the US more than tripled the chemical maker 's full-year net profits . The world 's largest chemicals producer by sales on Thursday said it would pay a dividend of EUR2.20 a share - more than analysts had expected - after it had achieved its target to earn a premium on its cost of capital in the past year . The German group , long known for its steady pay-out increases , shocked investors last year when it cut its dividend and brought a 15-year period of rising or steady dividends to an end . Jurgen Hambrecht , chief executive , hinted at another dividend rise for this year when he said the group expected to earn a high premium once again on the cost of capital in 2011 . The outgoing chief executive , who is set to pass the baton in May to Kurt Bock , at present chief financial officer , said the group aimed to slightly increase its sales and to "" significantly "" lift its income from operations this year . "" BASF has had a very strong start to 2011 , "" he said . But he added a note of caution when he said BASF was "" concerned about Libya "" and hoped that the situation there would calm down soon . The chemical maker operates a number of large oilfields with its Wintershall unit in the north African country . BASF this week said it had halted oil and gas production in Libya , where it used to produce as much as 100,000 barrels of oil a day . This represents 14 per cent of its exploration and production reserves in 2009 . In the fourth quarter , BASF sales rose by 25 per cent year on year to EUR16.42bn ( $22.6bn ) , exceeding analysts ' expectations . Earnings before interest and tax excluding one-offs climbed to EUR1.77bn but fell short of the EUR1.94bn analysts expected in a poll by news agency Reuters . BASF said its profit had been dented by more than EUR200m that it set aside for a staff incentive programme and by one-off costs for accelerated plant maintenance . In the full year 2010 , the group 's sales and profits climbed to a record . BASF has benefited from buoyant demand in Asia and the US in particular , where it was able to pass on rapidly rising raw material costs to its customers . With its broad range of industrial customers , ranging from carmakers to construction groups , the group is seen as a bellwether for the global economy .

Temasek reduced its stake of almost 2 per cent in the UK 's third largest bank over several weeks from the turn of the year , according to people familiar with the sale . Barclays shares fell as low as 51p in January on fears that it would join the list of UK banks needing a government bail-out .

Yesterday , Abu Dhabi also completed its sale of pound(s)1.25bn in reserve capital notes - instruments similar to preference shares - which was about half the stake it bought in November . Demand was more than three times the amount on offer , signalling growing investor confidence in bank debt . Temasek first invested in Barclays in mid-2007 when Barclays was pitted against Royal Bank of Scotland in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to buy ABN Amro . At the time , Temasek purchased 135m shares , or about 1.61 per cent of Barclays . Last year , Temasek said it would spend up to pound(s)200m when Barclays launched a placing to raise pound(s)4.5bn.

JPMorgan Cazenove , joint broker to Tesco , is forecasting a 1.5 per cent decline in UK sales from stores open at least a year , in the six weeks to January 7 , representing a sharp deterioration from the previous reported trading period . This weak trading performance from Britain 's most consistently profitable retailer highlights how its high-profile price cutting campaign this autumn , which cost the retailer more than pound(s)500m , has failed to revive its UK performance , putting pressure on new chief executive Philip Clarke , and Richard Brasher , head of Tesco 's UK business . Two people close to the company , and one Tesco insider , said Mr Brasher had wanted to go further with the so-called "" Big Price Drop "" to fight back against nimbler rivals in its home market . Tesco said when it announced the first wave of price cuts in September that UK profit would be broadly flat in the second half of its financial year . However , Mr Clarke , who took over from Sir Terry Leahy in March , and finance director Laurie McIlwee , were keen to avoid a bigger hit to profits , the insider said . Tesco dismissed any tensions over the pricing strategy as "" nonsense "" . Tesco 's weak trading performance comes as the retailer has suffered a string of top management departures over the past few months . The latest to leave is Per Bank , commercial director for the UK non-food business , who was this week named as chief executive of Maersk 's Dansk Supermarked . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , who has a strong record of forecasting Tesco 's performance , said : "" Undoubtedly this will be one of the worst Christmases for Tesco . The disappointing trading performance must be something that is at the top of senior management 's worry list . "" He said he expected Tesco to be the "" laggard "" of the big four supermarkets in terms of sales performance over the crucial Christmas and New Year trading period . On Friday , Nielsen said Tesco had the lowest sales growth of the big four in the four weeks to December 24 . But Mr Black said it was possible that the volume of goods sold over Christmas may be improving . In Tesco 's third quarter , it outperformed the market on volume , but the price cuts meant less money was going through its tills .

The world 's third biggest retailer by sales is planning to open 80 shopping centres in China by 2016 , amounting to 40m sq ft , with Tesco hypermarkets taking a fifth of the floorspace and other retailers taking the rest . It means that Tesco will open more floorspace in China in five years than it has done over eight decades in the UK where it has a footprint of 33m sq ft. The aggressive Chinese expansion comes in spite of a difficult year for the retailer 's other international operations , including in the US . The central European businesses , bar Poland , suffered falls in profits during the recession . In the UK , Tesco was back on track after a difficult start to 2009 . Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , said Tesco 's efforts to woo consumers with extra Clubcard points and the credit crunch "" discounter "" range had paid off . "" I am pleased we have been able to improve relative performance , we have got back in the lead , "" he said , as UK sales rose 4.2 per cent to pound(s)42bn for the year ending February 27 . Tesco said it would add 2.4m sq ft of space , with plans for 181 new Tesco Express stores and 26 more Tesco Extras . Reporting group sales up 6 per cent to pound(s)57bn over the year , with pre-tax profits up 9 per cent at pound(s)3.2bn , Sir Terry said Asia was a "" major engine of growth of the group "" . Tesco will invest pound(s)2bn in China over the next five years but would not say how much of the pound(s)1.5bn of capital spending overseas in this financial year would be directed into China . "" The greatest surprise from Tesco 's results was the pace and magnitude of its development plans in China , "" said Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital . He predicted Tesco would dip into a loss of about pound(s)25m in China after a broadly break-even performance . The Asian region overall was the star performer , with sales up by a fifth to pound(s)9.01bn and profits up 24 per cent to pound(s)440m . In Central Europe , sales fell 0.7 per cent to pound(s)10bn , with trading profit off 4 per cent to pound(s)474m . In the US the losses ran to pound(s)165m for the year .

Sainsbury would automatically be referred to the Office of Fair Trading , while Tesco is apparently free to expand without investigation . This is probably wrong , since with a merger or takeover , competition , the principal subject of an investigation , is eliminated not through consumer choice , but through corporate action - something over which the public has little influence . By comparison , Tesco 's expansion continues by virtue of its competitive edge and what it offers customers . Consumers decide that Tesco 's expansion will continue by choosing to shop there .

3-10-2007,555,"Tesco 's overseas bet Though brutal weather in June and July scared off shoppers , Sir Terry Leahy , Tesco 's chief executive , was resolutely upbeat about the future as the retailer reported underlying first-half trading profits of Pounds 1.2bn , a 10 per cent rise year on year . Is his unusually jolly tone justified ? Like-for-like sales in the UK , excluding fuel , grew 3.5 per cent , one of the lowest figures in years . Tesco executives took pains to blame the results on the lousy summer weather , including a comparison of hours of sunshine and same-store sales in their analyst presentation . There is evidence to support this claim . Rival Morrisons ' same-store summer sales were also unimpressive , up just 2.7 per cent year on year , and Tesco 's like-for-like sales improved in August along with the weather . Non-food sales , though small , grew faster . Although its dominance in the UK remains unchallenged , Tesco 's growth prospects lie abroad . International sales grew 22 per cent in the first half year on year and accounted for just one-quarter of Pounds 25bn total group sales . The figures include China for the first time ; Tesco now owns 90 per cent of its venture there . Four- fifths of the group 's new space this year will open outside the UK . Next month , Tesco opens its first US stores in California and the south-west . The specially designed Fresh & Easy chain seems to be positioning itself as the opposite of Wal-Mart . It emphasises healthy food , convenience and fitting into neighbourhoods . It also offers health insurance to employees . So far the US investment is tiny , but Tesco usually seeks to be a top player in the markets where it operates . The weak dollar could also make a US acquisition relatively cheap . The US economy may be teetering on the edge of recession but Tesco insists that it can make headway relative to rivals .

In April , Mr Clarke set out a strategic blueprint for Britain 's biggest supermarket chain by market share after its first profit warning in 20 years . However , City analysts still forecast a decline in sales from Tesco UK stores open at least a year when the retailer reports on June 11 . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , expects a decline in UK like-for-like sales of 1-2 per cent year on year , excluding fuel and VAT , in the retailer 's first quarter . With inflation of about 2.5 per cent , the volume of goods sold would be down 3-4 per cent . Andrew Kasoulis , analyst at Credit Suisse , forecasts a 1.5 per cent decline . This compares with a 1.6 per cent drop in UK like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter to the end of February , although it is an improvement on the 2.3 per cent decline over Christmas and the new year , Tesco 's worst performance for decades . Mr Black said the first-quarter performance would be in line with expectations , as Tesco was just starting to implement the changes Mr Clarke talked about in April , such as putting more staff into supermarkets and introducing improved ready meals . "" It 's all about basic stuff , "" he said . "" We would not be expecting Tesco to be doing anything other than performing in line with the fourth quarter , slightly underperforming the industry . I think that is part of the plan . "" Mr Kasoulis pointed out that the first quarter of this year - the 13 weeks to May 26 - would not include the run-in to the late May bank holiday , which boosts food sales , whereas last year it did . Although this year and last year 's reporting periods include Easter , the first quarter of the 2011-2012 financial year also included the Royal wedding . On top of that , the weather in April this year was poor . "" While we think there probably has been some underlying sales improvement , aided by the very high level of money-off coupons , we think April was weak [ impacted by the weather ] and the calendar will not unwind until the second quarter , "" said Mr Kasoulis in a note . The lack of obvious progress could raise eyebrows given the aggressive voucher promotions . Mr Black said the vouchering was "" very much about stabilising Tesco - they were losing market share apace and the first thing they had to do was stem the tide . "" Although the figures will make grim reading for Mr Clarke , Mr Black believes investors and analysts will give him more time . "" For Phil Clarke it 's just going to be a case of being stoic and determined . There is no quick fix , "" said Mr Black . "" If we were having this conversation this time next year , he would be under pressure , because a lot of the initiatives that are planned will be in-store and if customers are not biting the cherry at that point , there will be big issues to worry about . "" Shares in Tesco fell to below 300p last week . Excluding the period after the Lehman Brothers collapse in autumn 2008 , this was Tesco 's lowest share price since October 2005 . Between that date and May 30 2012 the FTSE 100 rose 2.2 per cent . Investors and analysts will not just be looking for signs of progress in the UK when Tesco reports its first-quarter performance . They will also be seeking signs of improvement in the US and an update on Korea , where new rules restricting hypermarket opening hours have been introduced . In addition , the City will be looking for evidence that Tesco Bank is making progress .

Analysts expect group sales to rise 9 per cent to pound(s)59bn , and pre-tax profit to rise more than 6 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn. As Tesco is the bellwether for the UK consumer economy , investors will be keen to hear chief executive Sir Terry Leahy 's views on the outlook for retail spending and for grocers , who face slowing growth on the back of falling food price inflation . This is important for Tesco given that about 70 per cent of its profits come from its UK arm . Analysts will want to hear how its retailing services arm , which includes the banking division , is performing . They will want evidence that the bank remains on track , given that it is yet to launch mortgages and current accounts in spite of a promise to shake up retail banking a year ago . Bernstein Research has pencilled in operating profits of pound(s)263m , or 10 per cent of the UK operating profit , for the year to March . Results in Tesco 's international business - Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities expects revenues to be 13.4 per cent higher at pound(s)18.3bn - will be mixed , with continental Europe hard hit . Shore Capital expects profits there , given the struggles of economies such as the Irish Republic and Hungary , to be down 10 per cent .

19-01-2013,561,"Tesco ( TSCO ) Nine months into a plan to overhaul the UK business and one year after its profit warning , Tesco 's Christmas sales figures look relatively underwhelming . In the six weeks to January 5 , group like-for-like sales excluding petrol were up 0.3 per cent . UK like-for-like sales , excluding petrol and stripping out sales from Clubcard vouchers , were broadly in line with expectations , rising 1.4 per cent , boosted by better food and online sales . But broker Seymour Pierce points out that this is a poor return considering Tesco has invested 1 per cent of its tight margin this financial year to achieve it , following a profit warning a year ago after the group 's dire performance at Christmas 2011 . The supermarket is also struggling internationally . Like-for-like sales in Asia and central Europe continued to decline , while in the US , where Tesco is reviewing its Fresh & Easy business , like-for-like sales fell 2.1 per cent . A cut-price sale of the business is widely expected . Managers say the tough trading conditions will continue to the year-end , particularly in central Europe . There are signs that Tesco 's six-point plan to improve its UK business is starting to pay off , but inflation and equally tough trading conditions are forecast this year , especially in its international businesses .

1-10-2008,563,"Tesco "" Is it safe ? "" hissed Laurence Olivier as he drilled into Dustin Hoffman 's molar in Marathon Man . That is the question uppermost on investors ' minds . As its 10 per cent increase in first half profits yesterday showed , Tesco is about as safe as things come in these uncertain , paranoid times . True , the world 's third largest retailer is not entirely defying gravity . UK underlying sales growth of 3.7 per cent lags behind more price-orientated competitors such as Morrisons and Wal-Mart 's Asda , even if the threat from "" deep "" discounters such as Aldi is exaggerated . Asda is achieving superior growth in spite of more exposure to volatile non-food products . Tesco 's 4 per cent higher non-food sales came from a significant , unspecified , space rise- meaning sales densities fell . Internationally , sales growth of 1 per cent from stores open at least a year is underwhelming , given the amount of space added . Growth is also being bought with eye-watering capital expenditure - up from pound(s)1.6bn to pound(s)2.5bn in the first half . But the overall package remains solidly attractive . With innovations such as Tesco Value in 1992 , and its recent "" Discount Brands at Tesco "" range , Tesco has proved it can trade resiliently through UK downturns , and outperform in the good times . Meanwhile , it has made a better fist of international expansion than many peers , positioning itself well to take advantage of opportunities in countries such as China . Sir Terry Leahy , its phlegmatic chief executive , is creating a group with sufficiently diverse formats , store sizes and markets that it can withstand most setbacks . The danger is that an economic slump induced by the banking turmoil could lure UK supermarkets into their first genuinely no-holds-barred price war since the 1970s . Tesco 's size , and marketing and retail execution skills , should help it weather even that . At 14 times current-year earnings , its shares hardly fall in the deep discount category . But safety has a price .",tesco
20-04-2011,565,"Tesco Chief executives usually come out fighting when they release poor results . Philip Clarke came out apologising . We messed up some things , Tesco 's new chief executive as good as said on Tuesday , surprising investors used to his predecessor 's insistence that everything was perfect ( which , in Sir Terry Leahy 's defence , it often was ) . Mr Clarke 's honesty is refreshing but he need not be too glum . It is true that the UK business has stagnated . Underlying sales were flat last year and profit margins declined slightly . Some of this was self-inflicted : Tesco managed to lose share in electronics , for example , even though consumers are looking to trade down . Mostly , though , the UK supermarket business is just rough . The big chains are building more stores even though consumers are spending less . They will all suffer the consequences . Tesco at least has an advantage that J Sainsbury , Wm Morrison and Asda do not : it makes about a third of its sales and profits outside the UK . Success overseas is patchy ( the US business is still bleeding cash ; the Chinese one has not broken even as quickly as Tesco expected ) but overall trading profit rose 11 per cent in Europe and 30 per cent in Asia . This expansion has been expensive . Tesco 's return on capital employed is hardly any higher than it was in 2006 . But Mr Clarke promises a new era of capital discipline and aims to increase ROCE from 12.9 per cent last year to 14.6 per cent by 2015 . He has linked senior managers ' pay to ROCE improvement , which suggests he means it . Tesco offers better growth opportunities than peers , yet it is valued at 11 times this year 's earnings , compared with J Sainsbury 's 13 times .

25-03-2006,567,"Tesco In the real estate equivalent of supermarket sweep , could Tesco put its property portfolio into a trolley marked "" Reit "" ? Wednesday 's Budget opened the way for the development of a UK real estate investment trust market . It is logical that Tesco , with a freehold property portfolio with a conservative book value of Pounds 12bn , should consider its options . Conversion to Reit status may not be straightforward . Draft legislation published in December does not allow for owner-occupied property to be part of a Reit and there was no mention of altering this on Budget day . Tesco believes in the benefits of retaining control and flexibility over scarce land . In creating a Reit , it would have to relinquish ownership , similar to a sale-and-lease-back transaction . There are benefits : Tesco would avoid capital gains tax on the asset sales , which should far outweigh the one-off cost to convert . Rental income in the Reit would be tax free , but lease payments are tax deductible , providing an ongoing benefit . It is less clear that Tesco has the right balance sheet to extract these benefits , assuming the proceeds were returned to shareholders . Tesco 's net debt is not that large , but capital expenditure is high . Operating free cash flow does not cover annual interest , tax and dividend expense , even before considering the additional constraint of lease payments of , say , Pounds 500m . Investors should not hold their breath for a Reit-related share buy- back .",tesco

Tesco 's foray into tablets , via the pound(s)119 Hudl , will not be an easy win . The likes of Acer , Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard sell devices at similar price points . Even Microsoft has struggled to make an impact on the tablet market . Why is Tesco getting involved ? Hudl sales will make little impact on profits . True , the market is growing . According to Gartner , global tablet sales will more than double between now and 2017 . Yet Tesco would have to sell over 5m Hudls a year to even reach 1 per cent of turnover . Tesco says it will be profitable . But analysts are unlikely to be overhauling their financial models . What the Hudl does represent is an effort to find growth in the stagnant UK supermarket industry . Tesco has cut back its UK store expansion plans and is being more selective overseas . But growth will have to come from somewhere . Hence the development of Tesco bank and the acquisition of online film and music businesses . Hudl owners will be able to access all these services , as well as buy groceries , via a conveniently placed permanent button . It is like a Tesco store in the palm of your hand . By pricing it low , Tesco will be hoping to lure impoverished students and the like , who are the big grocery shoppers of the future . In that respect , Tesco has little to lose and is right to be bold . Failure would be embarrassing , but after the Fresh & Easy debacle and the horsemeat scandal the company is used to dealing with setbacks . It will not say what it has spent on the project , but it is unlikely to be a large share of the annual pound(s)3bn capex bill .

These reached Pounds 74m in the first half and are expected to continue apace , as Tesco reduces the amount of property it owns from 85 per cent to about 70 per cent of its portfolio . The group 's share buy-back programme is now running , though the Pounds 1.5bn targeted over the next five years is insignificant in the context of the company 's near Pounds 30bn capitalisation . Still , a dividend yield approaching 2.8 per cent this year seems acceptable for a company investing heavily in growth opportunities . And despite a difficult time in Hungary , the company 's growth credentials are intact , with plenty of scope in both eastern Europe and Asia . In the UK , like-for-like sales growth in the second quarter of 6.6 per cent year-on-year looks roughly in line , rather than ahead of competitors . If anything , the most immediate risk may lie in stronger price competitiveness in the UK market . Tesco 's US expansion , though , remains shrouded in secrecy ahead of the first store openings next year : the slide in the group 's presentation representing US plans showed an empty stretch of mud with two trucks - presumably soon to be a building site . But the relatively small size of the investment - Pounds 250m annually for the next few years - should encourage investors to be patient .",tesco
4-10-2012,573,"Tesco "" Every little helps , "" says Tesco 's tagline as it tries to convince shoppers that it goes the extra mile to help them out . It might be hoping that investors take a similar view . Yesterday 's first-half results were atrocious , with profits for the UK company down in almost all areas of the business . But buried in the statement was a small number that could point to bigger improvements ahead . The rate of decline in UK like-for-like sales slowed in the second quarter against the first - from 1.1 per cent to 0.8 per cent - as a turnround plan that involves back-to-basics wisdom such as low prices , more welcoming stores and higher staffing took effect . That is a decent start but it can not yet be counted as evidence that January 's profit warning was a blip rather than the start of a long , Carrefour-style decline . The self-help measures might well help Tesco to dig itself out of its current hole - and a decent update from J Sainsbury suggests the UK does not have to be a dismal place for a food retailer - but other problems abound . Demand in China is failing to keep up with new space being added , opening hours in Korea have been forcibly restricted and the US operation is still a worry . Tesco 's response has been to rein in spending . The capital expenditure-to-sales ratio is likely to fall to less than 5 per cent next year . In 2009 it was higher than 8 per cent . That will bring its ratio closer to peers such as Walmart , Carrefour and Metro . That is a smart move in tough conditions but it does not exactly make for a thrilling investment proposition . On 10 times forecast earnings , Tesco is at a discount to the likes of Sainsbury ( 12 ) and Walmart ( 14 ) . But Tesco is no longer the growth story it once was and bargain hunters should hold off until there is more evidence of a recovery than one quarter of improvement in like-for-like sales numbers .",tesco
6-10-2011,575,"Tesco Tesco investors knew that the drastically reduced spending power of UK consumers was always going to make for a tough first half . The company 's interims were resilient enough , but it is during a downturn that the UK supermarket group 's breathless expansion will be put to its severest test . Tesco 's policy seems to be working . The UK business , its main earnings engine , increased trading profit by 5 per cent to pound(s)1.3bn on sales 6 per cent higher . Strip out the effect of new stores , however , and sales excluding petrol and value added tax fell by 0.5 per cent , mostly in the second quarter . So much for the past . The outlook is gloomier : Tesco predicts flat profit in the second half from a year ago . Never mind . Tesco 's Asian and European operations , where first-half trading profit rose 19 per cent and 12 per cent respectively , should continue to ease the pain . Its earnings diversity gives it an edge over UK peers J Sainsbury , Wm Morrison and Asda . However , its US business Fresh & Easy continues to fire blanks . The division is expected to break even in the next two years . For now , Tesco 's biggest concern is its bank . Group trading profit , which rose by 3.7 per cent to pound(s)1.8bn , would have been 4.5 percentage points higher without a pound(s)57m one-off provision for personal protection insurance mis-selling claims . Given the worsening UK market conditions , and Tesco 's target of boosting the return on capital employed to 15 per cent by 2015 from 13 per cent last year , it needs to slow its pace of capital expenditure from its range of 5-5.5 per cent of revenue . This would give it the flexibility to cut debt and boost shareholder returns . Its shares , trading on a multiple of 11 times forward earnings - a 5 per cent discount to pure UK play Wm Morrison - suggest investors still fear that Tesco is lavishing cash on a race with no winner .",tesco
6-12-2012,577,"Tesco About time too . Tesco 's decision to get out of the US ( or , in corporate-speak , launch a "" strategic review "" of the business ) is long overdue . For a business that accounted for only 1 per cent of Tesco 's sales in the first half of the year it attracted a disproportionate amount of attention . Tesco has little to show for the pound(s)1bn it has spent in the US , other than pound(s)800m of accumulated losses and a 200-store estate that struggled to attract shoppers . Decision time was rapidly approaching . Much of the investment to date has gone on overheads - supply chains , manufacturing bases , the lot . And that infrastructure could cope with far more than 200 stores , so to keep the chain at the current size made little sense . Credit Suisse had forecast that its Fresh & Easy US business would break even in 2014-2015 . But even assuming 5 per cent revenue growth per year after that , and a 5.5 per cent operating margin , Fresh & Easy would not have reached the group 's 14.6 per cent return on capital target until 2034 . Getting there faster would have required more investment in stores . And Tesco is no longer in the mood to be a big spender . With the core UK business struggling ( like-for-like sales in the UK fell 1.2 per cent in the third quarter ) , the company is becoming increasingly frugal and picking its targets far more carefully . A sub-scale operation in a mature market no longer fits the bill . As it is , Deutsche Bank says that an exit from the US will improve the group 's return on capital by 120 basis points . The US distraction is not entirely out of the way - Tesco still has to find an exit route and deal with a possible write-off - but the decision to leave is a good start . The challenge now is for the company to find other homes for its capital that are not only more attractive than the US in their own right , but will also keep the company growing despite its domestic troubles .",tesco
7-10-2009,579,"Tesco The first word of Tesco 's half-year earnings statement was , appropriately , "" solid "" . The problem is that investors have long come to expect something more than solid from the world 's third-biggest retailer . Tesco 's lacklustre UK sales growth is concerning when competitors J Sainsbury ( expected to report buoyant figures today ) and Wm Morrison have accelerated like-for-like growth through the recession . The question is whether this is a temporary weakness and Tesco will rebound , or whether - having grabbed one-third of the UK grocery market and a 10th of non-food - its best growth days are over . For now , evidence still points to the former . Tesco responded more aggressively than competitors to last year 's threat from fast-expanding "" deep "" discounters such as Germany 's Aldi . Its "" discount brands at Tesco "" initiative introduced price deflation into its figures while competitors still had price inflation and encouraged its shoppers to trade down . The strategy appears to have achieved its aim . Deep discounters ' market share gains have ground to a halt , and with the anniversary of discount brands ' launch now passed , Tesco says its UK like-for-like sales growth has "" converged with the industry "" . Profit growth was also tempered by higher interest costs after Tesco acquired Korea 's Homever chain for pound(s)958m and bought out Royal Bank of Scotland 's 50 per cent share in their financial services joint venture for pound(s)950m last year . The case for continuing growth is intact . International sales - now one-third of Tesco 's total - should accelerate as markets in central Europe and Asia pull out of the doldrums . Opportunities to increase UK sales of clothing , mobile phones , electrical goods and financial services are still huge . Reflecting the non-food prospects , Tesco 's shares have outperformed Sainsbury and Morrison this year , though remain at a discount . The gap should close as evidence mounts that Tesco can shift back from solid to scintillating .",tesco
17-06-2009,581,"Tesco aims to close growth gap Food & DRUG Retailers ; Group says it is catching UK rivals ; International sales buoy first quarter Tesco insisted it was narrowing the gap on faster-growing UK rivals Wm Morrison , J Sainsbury and Asda , as international sales buoyed its first-quarter performance . Revealing a 4.3 per cent increase in first quarter UK like-for-like sales - in line with analysts ' forecasts - Laurie McIlwee , finance director , said Tesco was back on its game and would continue to close in on smaller competitors . "" I would not deny we would want to close the relative performance gap , and it is closing , "" he said . The comments come ahead of first-quarter figures today from Sainsbury , which are expected to reveal a 6.4 per cent increase in like-for-like sales . Tesco 's performance in its domestic market , which accounts for more than two-thirds of its profit and sales , was boosted by shoppers returning to its premium brands . Demand for non-food items was also picking up , with "" modest "" like-for-like sales growth resuming in recent weeks . Mr McIlwee said shoppers were buying more clothes , electricals and home entertainment products , as well as garden and camping equipment as Britons forfeited foreign holidays . Group sales for the 13 weeks to May 30 rose 9.7 per cent including petrol , and 12.6 per cent excluding such sales . The shares closed up 5.5p at 361.6p. International sales rose 20.1 per cent , or 11.4 per cent at constant exchange rates , boosted by Asian markets , but held back by Ireland where Tesco has been trying to stem the flow of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains in Northern Ireland . Sales in the US - where Tesco has been forced to slow its expansion plans - almost tripled , although Mr McIlwee acknowledged that the US operation was an "" immature and small business "" . Tesco also showed no let up in its push into banking as it attempts to build what Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , described as the "" people 's bank "" . Mr McIlwee acknowledged that Tesco was seeing a "" slight uptick "" in bad debts from its credit card and loan book , although he also said that Tesco 's bad debt performance was better than banking rivals and would not cause the market to change its forecasts of current year profits . Tesco hopes to launch a current account "" in the not too distant future "" , possibly in the current year to February 2010 or the next . However , people familiar with the situation indicated that a current account was most likely to be introduced towards the end of 2010 . Tesco 's personal finance operation contributed 2.2 percentage points to overall UK sales growth of 9.3 per cent . "" The customer count is increasing steadily , "" said Mr McIlwee .

14-01-2009,583,"Tesco and discounters Two things are now clear about UK Christmas sales . First , they were n't cataclysmic . The British Retail Consortium laments the worst Christmas since its "" retail sales monitor "" series began - but that was in 1994 , after the last recession . This season , like-for-like sales fell 3.3 per cent , but the car industry , for one , would kill for such figures . Allow for the December value added tax reduction and , Credit Suisse reckons , the underlying decline was 1.8 per cent . Similarly , the 2.5 per cent gain at Tesco , which has a third of the grocery market , represents a 3.5 per cent rise , VAT-adjusted . So this was not Tesco 's worst Christmas since the 1990s , but only its worst since last year . Second , price-led formats are thriving - Aldi , the German-owned discounter , says total UK sales rose 22 per cent in December . But that does not foreshadow a lasting structural shift . Aldi is growing fast , but from a puny base and mostly by adding stores . Its market share increased from 2.6 per cent to 3 per cent in 2008 , good for the year but hardly stunning after a decade and a half in the UK . The discount segment 's 6 per cent grocery market share has barely changed for years . That is not to say Tesco is unaffected . Reduction in selling prices of a couple of percentage points at the retailer in recent months stem in part from its September introduction of "" discount brands "" , its latest initiative to keep discounters at bay . The step-up in its Christmas sales from the previous quarter suggests the initiative is paying off - and could start denting the currently superior performance of rival supermarket groups Sainsbury , Wm Morrison , and Wal-Mart 's Asda . The recession will leave gaps on the high street . But the established order is not under threat . The balance of power will stay with the big players , not the price cutters .",tesco and discounters

3-06-2005,587,"Tesco at a discount Alison Smith - Lombard So much for record Pounds 2bn profit , gangbuster sales growth and a market share above 30 per cent . While Tesco causes fear and loathing almost everywhere else on the high street , its shares have trailed the food retailing sector by 1.6 per cent this year . As performances go , that is not much better than Wm Morrison , and worse than J Sainsbury . The sector has been buoyed by bid premiums for Somerfield but that hardly explains why Tesco 's shares have fallen in absolute terms . One theory is that Sir Terry Leahy 's paranoia about complacency has infected investors . They fear Tesco will eventually be cut down to size either by government regulation or a consumer backlash in the home market , from where it derives 80 per cent of sales . Another is that Tesco will wage an overly aggressive acquisition campaign overseas , where its sales record to date has been mixed and returns have only recently begun to improve . The pessimism , of course , could stem from the company 's own conservatism about this year 's outlook . However , most analysts expect underlying sales growth of 5 to 6 per cent , which would be up to Pounds 900m more than Tesco officially budgeted for . Some already have their eye on Pounds 3bn in profit in coming years . Tesco makes no attempt to foster such speculation . At least as far as its profit go , its approach is to play it down - that way it gets less scrutiny . With such paranoia guiding the company , its overseas ambitions should remain realistic , making this a good long-term buying opportunity .

21-05-2005,589,"Tesco beats M&S sales of non-foods FOOD RETAILERS Tesco is now selling more non-food goods than Marks and Spencer , the high street icon , as the UK 's largest and most profitable retailer powers ahead in its clothing , electricals and homeware ranges , according to research released yesterday . Verdict Research , the retailing research and consultancy firm , estimates that Tesco sold Pounds 4.6bn of grocers non-food products in 2004 compared with the Pounds 4.4bn sold by M&S . Only Dixons , with its out-of-town Dixons and PC World superstores , had a bigger market share of the grocers ' non-food market with Pounds 5.1bn. "" M&S and Tesco have had strongly contrasting fortunes in recent years , "" said Gavin Rothwell , senior retail analyst at Verdict . "" But this latest development means Tesco has overtaken M&S in its key area of competence . No high street orientated retailer sells more non-food than Tesco . "" Sales of non-food products at big grocers such as Tesco and Asda have increased by nearly 60 per cent in the past five years . Verdict expects the rapid expansion to continue in the coming months , with grocers ' share of the non-food market set to expand to 12.7 per cent this year against 12.2 per cent in 2004 . That would take sales to Pounds 14.4bn in 2005 against Pounds 13.5bn last year . The aggressive targeting of non-food products by supermarket groups is putting increasing pressure on the high street , already struggling with a slowdown in consumer spending coupled with more competitive pricing . Boots , which last week reported a 11.4 per cent decline in profit before exceptionals to Pounds 481m , is one of the many retailers that has been hit by the march of supermarkets into the health and beauty market . Richard Baker , chief executive , said Tesco 's market share of toiletries is now on a par with Boots ' at just under 20 per cent . "" ( Our market share ) is down on five years ago . That is one reason we took action on pricing . We are going to fight tooth and claw for our market share . "" Citigroup said non-food retailers were going to have a particularly tough time in 2005 against the might of Tesco . It estimated that , if Tesco takes half of total non-food retail sales growth in 2005 , available market growth for non-food retailers would fall from 4.4 per cent in 2004 to 0.6 per cent this year . "" The maths of ( Tesco 's ) growth is absolutely brutal in a slowdown , "" said Citigroup in a note . "" If , as seems to be he case , Tesco is expanding non-food space while broadly maintaining sales growth rates in a slowdown , its impact on the residual non-food market becomes amplified .

5-12-2012,591,"Tesco boost a diversion from predicted bad news Tesco 's pound(s)1bn recovery plan for its UK business has been given a boost just a day before it releases what some analysts expect to be a disappointing trading update . According to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel , the consumer research group , Tesco experienced stronger than expected sales growth over the past four weeks . In the four weeks to November 25 , sales through Tesco 's tills rose 2.7 per cent year on year , ahead of the market at 2.5 per cent , and making it the fastest growing of the so-called big four supermarkets . Tesco 's grocery sales rose 5.2 per cent in the four weeks to November 25 , according to Kantar , compared with the market at 3.1 per cent , indicating that the retailer 's performance is being dragged down by sales of non-food items . The brighter picture comes ahead of today 's third-quarter update , when it is forecast to report flat to slightly negative sales growth for the three months to the end of November . This is a slowdown from the second quarter , when Tesco had its first rise in UK like-for-like sales for two years , up 0.1 per cent in the three months to the end of August . Analysts at Deutsche Bank , joint broker to Tesco , forecast a 0.8 per cent decline in Tesco 's UK like-for-like sales in the third quarter , driven mostly by weakness in non-food , while Shore Capital forecasts flat sales to a 1 per cent decline . However , Dave McCarthy , analyst at Investec Securities , said it was possible Tesco 's sales could be better than forecast , as recent trading will have been "" flattered by the timing and nature of promotions "" . Philip Clarke , chief executive of Tesco , is battling to turn round the UK business as it faces the twin pressures of weak consumers and nimbler rivals . Tesco is also facing headwinds from overseas , with like-for-like sales in its lossmaking US business forecast to rise by 4-5 per cent , according to Shore Capital . This would be only marginally ahead of the 3.6 per cent increase in the first quarter , regarded as disappointing by the market . The lack of momentum in US trading could increase calls among some investors for Mr Clarke to rethink the US venture . While Tesco experienced better trading in the past four weeks , sales growth slowed at J Sainsbury , from 5.3 per cent in October to 1.4 per cent in November . Sainsbury 's grocery sales rose by 1 per cent . Sainsbury declined to comment on the Kantar data but it is thought to have been affected by promotions at rivals as well as tough comparisons with the year-earlier period . Wm Morrison sales fell 1.7 per cent in November , according to Kantar .

4-01-2006,595,"Tesco bucks trend in year of missed targets and warnings In a year peppered with job losses , profit warnings and missed targets , Tesco managed to buck the wider malaise in the retailing sector and provided the high point of 2005 when it became the first UK retailer to break the Pounds 2bn profit barrier . It was also the year that saw Tesco 's share of the supermarket shopping sector pass 30 per cent as the UK 's biggest retailer - now spanning into non-food stores - asserted its dominance . But if Tesco was shining , plenty of others in the supermarket were struggling . Rival Wm Morrison 's woes were some of the most prominent stories of the yearas the UK 's fourth-largest supermarket struggled with the integration of its Pounds 3.3bn acquisition of Safeway in March 2004 . The Bradford-based retailer , led by 74-year-old Sir Ken Morrison , grappled with four profit warnings in a few months as the management team was forced to admit its internal accounting team could not cope with the enlarged business . The finance director was forced to quit - and Sir Ken came under severe pressure amid a very public boardroom spat over the pace of corporate reform . Then , over in Leeds , Andy Bond , Asda 's chief executive , announced that the UK 's second-largest supermarket group was also in trouble as it missed two consecutive quarters of internal sales and profit targets . Richard Baker from Boots came under pressure after dishing out two rapid profit warnings on the back of worsening trading . As a panacea to disgruntled shareholders , he said he was selling BHI , its over-the-counter drugs business . It sold to Reckitt Benckiser for Pounds 1.92bn. But that turned out to be a smokescreen for a far bigger deal : the proposed Pounds 7bn merger between Boots and Alliance UniChem .

15-05-2008,597,"Tesco buys 36 stores in South Korea for Pounds 1bn By SONG JUNG-A and ELIZABETH RIGBY Tesco is breaking its decade-long pursuit of overseas organic growth , with a record cash purchase of a chain of hypermarkets in South Korea . Britain 's biggest chain is acquiring 36 stores owned by E-Land Group in and round Seoul , where 11m potential Tesco customers live , for just under Pounds 1bn , including the assumption of existing debt . This deal is the first time Tesco has spent anywhere near this kind of money on an international acquisition . Until now , it has preferred to grow from the ground up , through joint ventures with local partners and store-by-store growth . But Phil Clarke , international director of Tesco , stressed that this did not herald a more radical era of expansion for the grocer . He said : "" We prefer organic growth , that is always our priority and will remain so , but these 36 stores give us two and a bit years of growth in one hit . In four and a half years in this job I have done two deals ( the other one being an asset swap with Carrefour ) . I do n't see an acceleration of deals at all "" . It does show that Tesco is determined to gain pole position in chosen markets . Korea is the retailer 's biggest market outside the UK , with Pounds 2.7bn of sales coming from 66 hypermarkets and 72 convenience stores . That turnover will be closer to Pounds 4bn once the deal goes through . Tesco said the Korean deal would have a neutral impact on earnings in the second year of ownership and boost earnings beyond that . About half the price was the assumption of debt . Tesco will fund the deal from existing facilities . Mr Clarke tried to buy the stores back in 2006 , when Carrefour , the then-owners , decided to exit Korea , eventually selling the stores to E-Land for Euros 1.5bn( Dollars 2.3bn ) . JPMorgan said the acquistion gave Tesco a chance to close the gap on Shinsegae 's E-mart , which has sales of Won9,000bn ( Pounds ? ? bn ) , against Tesco 's Won5,900bn . "" Korea is a very interesting market long-term as the sector has become a two-horse race , "" it said . Elsewhere , Mr Clarke is still working on India , and hinted that Tesco could be warming to Russia , a hotspot for rivals Wal-Mart and Carrefour . "" Russia is not never .

Against the backdrop of a global downturn , trading profit rose 8.8 per cent year-on-year to pound(s)3.1bn ( $4.5bn ) . As consumers across many of Tesco 's 14 markets tighten their belts , it lifted group sales by 13.5 per cent to pound(s)60bn . Even in the UK , where Tesco 's underlying sales growth of 3 per cent for the year is clearly lagging rivals Wm Morrison and Asda , Sir Terry still turned in a best-in-class trading margin of 6.2 per cent , helped by some crafty cost-cutting ( to the tune of pound(s)540m in the past financial year ) . So far , so good . But Sir Terry surprised with a couple of nasties in the results . First , the retailer 's net debt has ballooned to pound(s)9.6bn from pound(s)6.2bn in the past year . Second , Sir Terry 's ambition to build Fresh & Easy , a convenience business in the US - a venture on which the chief executive has staked his reputation - has performed worse than anyone dared imagine . Instead of opening up to 500 stores by February 2010 , Tesco will have at most 177 . Instead of breaking even this year , Tesco is now looking at another year of losses . It is hardly the auspicious start that Sir Terry desired . The first problem , assured Laurie McIIwee , the finance director , is not insurmountable . While net debt is some pound(s)1.6bn higher than Tesco had guided to last year ( it says pound(s)1bn of that is due to adverse currency movements ) , Mr McIIwee says it will be easy to bring it back down during the course of 2009 by , for example , selling property . Furthermore , it is unlikely to be scooping up businesses as it did last year when it splashed out nearly pound(s)1bn buying 36 hypermarkets in South Korea , while spending a similar amount buying in 50 per cent of Tesco Personal Finance from the Royal Bank of Scotland . But if the net debt situation is manageable , sorting out Tesco US is a little more out of Sir Terry 's control . "" You ca n't escape trying to start a business in the teeth of a downturn , "" said Sir Terry over a lunch of scallops and chicken , "" It is on the level of the IMF Asia crisis of 1997 . "" Having committed to invest up to pound(s)1.25bn in the chain in the five years to 2012 , Fresh & Easy , racked up another pound(s)140m of losses this year . The third challenge facing the chief executive is closer to home . Over the past year he has been fighting a battle against the hard discounters Aldi and Lidl , as well as his more entrenched rivals Asda and Wm Morrison , who have been stealing market share . Sir Terry , who garners more than two-thirds of his profits and sales from his home turf , knows he must turn this round . "" Some retailers are doing higher like for likes . We have to recognise that and examine whether we can do more , "" he says . He adds that part of the lag is due to the introduction last year of Tesco 's discount brands , which has "" helped consumers trade down in stores and reduces our rate of inflation "" ( which he says is 2-3 per cent below competitors ) . But he insists that the UK core is on the mend . Tesco says it has stemmed the flow of shoppers out of Tesco 's stores and into the arms of Lidl and Aldi . The next challenge is to get customers , who are shopping around supermarkets for bargains , to start spending more in Tesco once more . In the coming couple of weeks , Sir Terry is relaunching his 15m membership Clubcard loyalty scheme in an effort to get customers to spend more in his stores by improving the Clubcard incentives . He is also diversifying into retail banking and telecoms stores in an effort to eke out new revenue streams in a mature UK market . Having seen out 2008 successfully , Sir Terry is still going to find himself pushing water up a hill in the coming months . "" There are signs of stability in some markets , but it is too early to call it a recovery , "" he said yesterday . "" The market is always changing and you have to keep on your toes .

11-01-2013,601,"Tesco chief claims UK sales victory food & drug retailers Philip Clarke , chief executive of Tesco , claimed an early victory in his pound(s)1bn battle to turn round Tesco 's UK business after a profit warning a year ago , as he confirmed a reshuffle of his top team . The retailer said UK sales rose 1.8 per cent year-on-year in the six weeks to January 5 , on a "" like-for-like "" basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and the VAT sales tax . The increase is 1.4 per cent excluding vouchers . The gain follows a 0.6 per cent dip in the last reported quarter . The Christmas trading figures were much better than Tesco 's dire performance over the same six-week period a year earlier , when it posted a like-for-like sales decline of 2.3 per cent in the UK . That setback prompted the group 's first profit warning in two decades and a subsequent commitment to invest pound(s)1bn in turning round the UK business . "" We were on form this Christmas , "" said Mr Clarke . However , he said there was more work to do to transform the UK business , which still accounts for about two-thirds of sales and profits . "" It 's not just about fixing Christmas , "" he said . "" It 's about building a better Tesco . Christmas is a step along the way . "" Mr Clarke said the recent improvement in the UK was not solely the product of more aggressive money-off promotions in the wake of Tesco 's failure last Christmas to keep pace with rivals ' coupon deals . "" It 's a very broad-based series of improvements , "" he said , adding that it reflected increased staffing in stores , overhauls of its fresh meat and poultry section , a relaunch of its clothing range and other initiatives . He said Tesco had been galvanised to produce a better performance after the shock of the profit warning last year . "" People have been bruised and they felt a bit of failure at Tesco and they are not used to it , "" he said . Tesco also confirmed that Chris Bush , its UK chief operating officer , had been appointed UK managing director , allowing Mr Clarke to step back partly from the hands-on role he had taken in the attempt to re-energise the British business . Investors and the board have been keen for Mr Clarke to spend more time on strategic issues outside of the UK , including how Tesco extricates itself from the US at the least cost to shareholders . "" I 'm just stepping back a little , not a lot , "" he said . Some analysts suggested that the appointment of Mr Bush put him among the field of eventual successors to Mr Clarke . Ken Towle , formerly internet retailing director at Tesco , will become chief executive of Tesco 's business in central Europe when Gordon Fryett retires later this year , while Robin Terrell is appointed as multi-channel director . Tesco said like-for-like sales in Europe fell 3.6 per cent , and 2.1 per cent in the US . Like-for-like sales in Asia fell 0.2 per cent . The shares rose 1.8 per cent to 355.4p.

4-10-2012,603,"Tesco chief issues US ultimatum Fresh & Easy business put on notice by Clarke ; Retailer reports 12 % fall in pre-tax profit Philip Clarke , chief executive of Tesco , issued an ultimatum to Fresh & Easy , its struggling US business , as he unveiled the retailer 's first fall in pre-tax profits for almost 20 years . Mr Clarke , who also reported Tesco 's first increase in under-lying UK sales for almost two years , said Fresh & Easy needed to "" persuade "" him it had a future with the group . He said he would cut capital expenditure in the US to "" nearly nothing "" . It is estimated the US business has already sucked in almost pound(s)1bn of capital . Mr Clarke took the same approach to Tesco 's Japanese business before he decided to sell it . Tesco will open only a "" handful "" of stores in the US . Instead , it would focus on generating profits from its existing stores . "" I 'm very focused on making sure that Fresh & Easy delivers , "" he said . "" When I focus , you know what that means . It means I expect performance . "" He said Fresh & Easy had "" stumbled "" in the first half , disappointing with losses of pound(s)74m , broadly the same as last year . Mr Clarke 's comments came as a pound(s)1bn investment to turn round Tesco 's UK business , plus a decline in international earnings , cut group pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to pound(s)1.66bn in the six months to August 25 , the first fall for 18 years . Sales rose 1.6 per cent to pound(s)32.3bn. However , Mr Clarke was able to point to some improvement in the UK , which in January was the source of the group 's first profit warning in 20 years . . Sales from UK stores open at least a year rose 0.1 per cent in the second quarter , excluding fuel and value added tax , against a 1.5 per cent decline in the first quarter and a 2.3 per cent fall over the crucial Christmas and New Year period . However , this was overshadowed by J Sainsbury , which reported better than expected like-for-like sales growth of 1.9 per cent , excluding fuel and VAT . Mr Clarke said of Tesco 's UK sales performance : "" The signs are encouraging . But we have a long way to go . "" Tesco was hit by falling earnings in the UK , Europe and Asia , after regulatory changes in South Korea , its biggest business outside its home market . Some analysts continued to trim their earnings estimates , with Shore Capital 's forecast that full-year pre-tax profits excluding property would fall by up to pound(s)150m to pound(s)3.15bn. One top-20 shareholder said : "" [ Tesco 's ] engines for growth are misfiring , and their core business continues to be under competitive pressure . "" Shares fell 2.6 per cent to 327.95p.

After a slew of profit warnings from retailers this week , the grocers are expected to prove more resilient . However , Tesco will not be immune from the severe weather that swept the country in the weeks before Christmas . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , forecasts UK sales from stores open at least a year , excluding fuel and value added tax , to grow 1-2 per cent year on year for the six weeks to January 8 .

7-03-2013,607,"Tesco chief wins applause from analysts for turnround efforts Tesco rallied to its best level since last year 's profit warning yesterday as analysts backed the group to regain investors ' trust . Improved focus and margin investment have been the first results of chief executive Philip Clarke 's three-year turnround programme , which has put Tesco on a firmer footing , said Shore Capital . "" The hard yards undertaken to date allows for management to perhaps think a little more intently upon a phase of Tesco 's development that is ' free ' rather than operating cash flow orientated , a strategy that may be seen and be more shareholder friendly . "" Credit Suisse also turned positive on Tesco , which rose 1.6 per cent to 378.2p. Investors may be overlooking Tesco 's two-decade history of "" exceptionally strong shareholder returns "" because of its struggles to sustain like-for-like sales , "" but we think growth remains ingrained in company culture , "" Credit Suisse said . Results next month should emphasise capital discipline and sustainable growth , it said . The dissenting voice came from Morgan Stanley . Its team worried about legislation in Korea , Tesco 's largest and likely its most profitable overseas market . Korea has been implementing a law passed in 2011 that gives local authorities the power to limit opening hours , said Morgan Stanley . The legislation "" is accelerating the secular shift away from hypermarkets and in favour of convenience stores "" , it said . With hypermarkets making up 92 per cent of Tesco 's Korean floorspace , like-for-like sales in the country may have dropped 8 per cent this year , it said . The wider market stalled at a five-year high , with the FTSE 100 down 4.31 points at 6,427.64. Vodafone added 22 points to the index with a 6.8 per cent gain to 180p . The jump came after Bloomberg reported that Vodafone had been in merger talks with Verizon Communications as recently as December , which had stalled over disagreements on leadership and corporate base . It was now more likely that Verizon would buy at least part of Vodafone 's stake in their Verizon Wireless partnership , with the UK group potentially avoiding capital gains tax by using an accounting method known as a C Reorganisation , Bloomberg said . Car insurer Admiral bounced 5.3 per cent to pound(s)11.34 after its annual earnings and dividend topped expectations . A dividend hike from Legal & General also beat forecasts , lifting its stock 2 per cent to 166p . BSkyB climbed 2.9 per cent to 888.5p after an industry website reported that News Corp was "" to mount another takeover bid "" , citing comments from News Corp chief operating officer Chase Carey to a London media conference . Investors saw little in Mr Carey 's comments to justify the bid hopes . He said News Corp was interested in maximising the value of its 39 per cent stake in BSkyB but stressed that the company was happy to wait for the right opportunity , which was not imminent . Imperial Tobacco fell 2.4 per cent to pound(s)23.85 and British American Tobacco was down 1.3 per cent to pound(s)35.19 on fears the UK would make plain packaging compulsory this year . Having hit a five-year high after results on Tuesday , Regus faded 4.2 per cent to 143.5p.

The chain said sales of organic foods rose 39 per cent , as its like-for-like performance came in just ahead of analysts ' expectations . The growth in popularity of organic and premium rangesechoed a trend seen by all the grocers over Christmas 2006 . Sainsbury 's premium sales grew by a fifth over the quarter . Wm Morrison - the best-performing supermarket chain over Christmas , with sales up 6.3 per cent - saw its premium lines grow 40 per cent . "" We have seen a flight to quality , "" said Steve Esom , managing director of Waitrose , the upmarket supermarket chain , which now accounts for 8 per cent of all organic sales in the UK . Marks and Spencer is thought to have seen sales of organic produce rise by half over the six-week Christmas window . The Competition Commission inquiry into the sector , which could see the watchdog release its initial findings next week , cast a shadow over Tesco'sperformance . "" The valuation is up with events and the forthcoming Competition Commission statement may raise some concerns , "" wrote David McCarthy , analyst at Citigroup . Tesco , which is nearly twice the size of its nearest competitors , is under particular scrutiny over its market share and "" land bank "" of sites for new stores . The shares , which have outperformed the FTSE All Share index by 5 per cent in the past month , closed 1 per cent lower at 415.5p. Tesco 's online division , which includes the first-time contribution of Tesco Direct , also saw strong growth , with sales up more than 30 per cent to Pounds 150m . Tesco said it would extend Tesco Direct in the spring , by putting dedicated kiosks into a number of its stores as well as extending the catalogue . However , Andrew Higginson , finance director , was cautious on prospects in the UK . "" We are concerned ( about the interest rate rises ) . We will be encouraging the Bank of England topause given the level of debt now . "" Consumers have been driving the economy for the past 10 to 15 years and it is important that we do n't kill the goose that laid the golden egg . "" Tesco said overall store inflation - the price paid by thecustomer - was 0.1 per cent higher over the period as rises in the price of food were offset by falling fuel prices and deflation in some of the chain 's non-food lines .

9-12-2009,611,"Tesco confident for US venture as sales rise after revamp general retailers ; Fresh & Easy set for full-year loss Tesco , the UK 's biggest retailer , said it was seeing signs of improvement in its fledgling business in the US , where it is battling to make a success of its Fresh & Easy venture . Tesco said its group sales had risen 8.8 per cent , excluding fuel , in the 13 weeks to November 28 , while its international sales had risen 12 per cent , excluding fuel , or 5.4 per cent excluding the effect of currency movements . The decline in international sales from stores open at least a year narrowed from 6.7 per cent to 3.7 per cent at constant exchange rates . Sales at Tesco 's US business rose 37.4 per cent . The retailer said like-for-like sales were stronger at Fresh & Easy , after an overhaul of the range in September and its first significant advertising campaign . "" We have seen a good increase in the number of customers coming into Fresh & Easy stores and a slight uptick in basket size , "" said Laurie McIlwee , finance director . Consequently , Tesco is maintaining its forecasts for Fresh & Easy . It expects the business to be on track to make a loss over the full year close to its $259m deficit last year . "" It is good that it has not got any worse , "" said Mr McIlwee . The group has also indicated that it could launch a loyalty scheme in the US . Elsewhere , Tesco saw a "" material improvement "" in Asia and Europe . It reported an increase in UK sales from stores open at least a year of 2.8 per cent , below the 3 per cent forecast by analysts polled by Reuters , and slower than the 3.1 per cent expansion in the second quarter . Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , said in October that Tesco was catching up with , and even eclipsing , UK rivals on sales . However , Mr McIlwee played this down . "" I would not say we are trending ahead . We are well in the pack , "" he said . He defended the group 's performance , which he said reflected the fact that increases in food prices were slowing . He said recent sales figures from some of Tesco 's rivals had included the effects of food price inflation . Some analysts pointed out that last weekend 's festive spending , which is thought to have been significant , was not included in the period . Mr McIlwee said competition remained intense in the UK , with promotional activity at an "" unprecedented level "" . Tesco is going into the period with a revamped Clubcard loyalty scheme .

4-06-2013,613,"Tesco drops to low amid talk of cut in earnings guidance LONDON Tesco hit a four-month low yesterday as analysts raised fears that the grocer would cut earnings guidance . Ahead of a trading update this week , Tesco slipped 1.9 per cent to 358.5p. Investec Securities argued that management needed to rein in guidance so that it can keep UK profit margins stable . "" Tesco is not a growth stock , nor is it an income stock and it lacks momentum , "" it said . With sales falling and customers moving online , its only option to defend margins is by raising prices , Investec said . But such a strategy would push the grocer "" down the doom loop , not shift it to the virtuous circle "" , it argued . The broker also believed that Tesco 's international expansion continued to destroy shareholder value . Analysts expect Tesco 's trading update due tomorrow to show that sales growth had stalled since Christmas , with same-store sales expected to be down by about 0.5 per cent . The reversal "" may remind the market that signs of Tesco 's recovery remain pretty limited , despite management 's best efforts "" , said Barclays . Wider market jitters sent the FTSE 100 lower by 57.97 points , or 0.9 per cent , to a one-month low of 6,525.12. Arm Holdings led the blue-chip fallers with a 7 per cent loss at 919p after Samsung , a key customer , confirmed it was switching to an Intel processor for one of its high-specification Android tablets . "" While the Arm camp should maintain dominant market share in the tablet PC market , the news Intel has finally landed a tier-one tablet design win could take a bite out of Arm 's share price , "" said Benchmark analysts .

3-11-2009,615,"Tesco edges up on talk of Ahold being potential target large caps Tesco was in focus yesterday as the wider market recovered some of the losses sustained in Friday 's late sell-off . Shares in the retailer edged up just 0.4 per cent to 408.95p ( but lagged behind the FTSE 100 ) following suggestions that it should bid for Dutch rival Ahold . Peter Brockwell , analyst at ING , said : "" The US market is too big for Tesco to ignore yet any attempt to increase the scale of Fresh & Easy could prove very risky . Ahold should be viewed as a one-off opportunity to acquire an undervalued asset at a low point in the US consumer cycle . "" Mr Brockwell , who retains a "" buy "" rating , believes a deal could yield synergies of pound(s)493m and lift earnings per share by 14-20 per cent . The FTSE 100 finished 59.95 points , or 1.2 per cent , higher at 5,104.5 , lifted by reports that showed US factory activity grew more quickly than expected in October and a surprise increase in pending home sales . The FTSE 250 rose 32.1 points , or 0.3 per cent , to 8,917.9. Mining stocks led the recovery as investors bought back into the sector or closed positions following the heavy losses last week . Vedanta rose 5 per cent to pound(s)21.97 , while Xstrata moved up 4.4 per cent to 921 1/2 p. Rio Tinto added 4.4 per cent to pound(s)28.13 following suggestions in the Australian press that its proposed iron ore joint venture with BHP Billiton , up 2.8 per cent to pound(s)16.90 , could unravel under pressure from shareholders . Should that happen , the theory is that BHP would then make another bid for Rio , offering 2.3 of its shares for every Rio share . Based on last night 's closing prices , that would value Rio at pound(s)38.87 a share . Elsewhere , Randgold Resources added 6 per cent to pound(s)41.96 after agreeing to buy an additional holding in the Moto gold project in the Democratic Republic of Congo . Arbuthnot Securities said : "" The acquisition enhances Randgold 's exposure to the project and locks the government into playing ball . As such , this should be viewed positively by the market .

Part-nationalised banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group saw heavy trading . Shares in RBS fell 7.8 per cent to 38.65p after the bank said it would have to sell more assets than expected to meet European state aid rules .

Robert Law , at Nomura , said : "" RBS continues to look demandingly valued to us .

The strong performance puts Tesco on track to increase its profits by more than Pounds 300m this year , which is the same amount of profit that J Sainsbury , its nearest quoted competitor , is set to make , according to Andrew Fowler , of house broker Merrill Lynch . "" If ( on Thursday ) the good ship Sainsbury reassured passengers with its gentle cruising speed , the starship Tesco remains on course to grow profit by the equivalent of the entire annual profit of its nearest quoted UK rival , "" Mr Fowler wrote in a note yesterday . Andy Higginson , finance director , described the 6.8 per cent rise in like-for-like sales growth excluding fuel in the 12 weeks to May 21 as "" exceptional "" . On Thursday , Sainsbury reported a 1.3 per cent rise in its underlying performance . "" These are exceptional numbers and some of that is down to the competition stumbling a bit , but we are also doing a great job , "" said Mr Higginson . Wm Morrison , the fourth largest supermarket group , has issued five profits warnings in less than a year as it struggles to integrate Safeway , while Asda 's new chief executive , Andy Bond , admitted recently that the second largest supermarket group was also struggling to boost sales . Mr Higginson said Tesco would continue to cut prices in the coming year , having invested Pounds 230m in price cuts last year . He said Tesco 's price deflation stood at 1.8 per cent over the quarter . The only blip was Tesco Personal Finance , which saw a rise in bad debts on credit cards and rising costs in car insurance claims . The news led Merrill to trim its profit forecast for the division by Pounds 11m , although it left full year group forecasts unchanged at Pounds 2.32bn. Tesco 's international business , which accounted for one-fifth of Tesco 's Pounds 37.1bn sales last year , was also "" performing well "" , with underlying sales up 5.5 per cent . Tesco said this was largely due to customers responding to price cuts in its network of 202 stores in central Europe . Overall group sales rose 14.6 per cent , with international sales up 19.9 per cent and the UK up 11.3 per cent .

9-09-2010,621,"Tesco experiments with Clubcard as it seeks to lift UK sales growth FOOD & DRUG RETAILERS Tesco has been experimenting with further beefing up its Clubcard loyalty scheme as it fights to boost sales growth in its home market . Britain 's biggest retailer has issued high-spending Clubcard holders with a coupon to earn triple points on their shopping . The move follows a scheme to let customers double the value of Clubcard vouchers in certain product areas . The triple Clubcard point promotion , which runs for three weeks , also comes close to the anniversary of Tesco 's move in August 2009 to reward Clubcard holders with two points for every pound(s)1 spent in store and online , rather than a single point . The move has raised questions among some analysts as to whether Tesco is considering a more permanent shift from double to triple points to continue the sales momentum from the loyalty scheme last year . "" Is this a test market for Tesco going to ongoing triple points either permanently or perhaps in the run-up to Christmas ? "" said Dave McCarthy , analyst at Evolution Securities , and a Tesco critic , in a note to clients . "" Double Green Shield Stamps led to treble stamps which in turn led to huge costs and major problems at Tesco in the 1970s . We hope that Tesco is not considering going to treble points permanently - this would mean Tesco starting each week with a cost of pound(s)15m-pound(s)20m , and it would make Clubcard one of the biggest costs the company faces after employment costs and costs of goods sold . "" However , people familiar with Tesco 's thinking insisted that the promotion was not a precursor to a permanent move . They said that Tesco ran Clubcard promotions from time to time on a variety of different fronts . Furthermore , the scheme is time limited . "" The triple points coupon is a short promotion targeted at a small number of the most dedicated Clubcard users . It is our way of saying thank you for their loyalty , "" a spokesman said . But the move comes at a delicate time for Tesco , which reports interim results early next month . In the first quarter , Tesco 's underlying sales growth in the UK fell to its lowest level in at least six years as falling food price inflation took its toll on the world 's third-largest grocer by sales . The promotion could also stoke controversy over the way Tesco reports the impact of extra Clubcard vouchers in its sales figures . Some analysts last year called for more clarity .

26-11-2005,623,"Tesco feels effect of weaker consumer confidence GENERAL RETAILERS Tesco showed yesterday it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as the UK 's biggest retailer reported the first slowdown in underlying sales growth for two years . Andy Higginson , finance director , said the 5.5 per cent rise in underlying sales in the 14 weeks to November 19 - against 6.6 per cent in the previous quarter - was "" very strong "" when taken against the retailer 's "" longer-term historical performance "" . "" The consumer is a little bit more cautious . The food market is steady and there is a little bit more growth , but non-food has been a bit tougher , "" he said yesterday . In September , Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , flagged that sales were going to be "" hard to come by "" in the UK because of rising fuel overheads and the impact of higher household debt . Andrew Fowler , analyst at Merrill Lynch , yesterday kept his full- year pre-tax profit forecast unchanged at Pounds 2.16bn , adding : "" There must have been some people who thought Sir Terry was just talking Tesco down . But it looks like he got it right . Even Tesco is not infallible . "" Tesco , which has a 30.2 per cent share of supermarket shopping in the UK , has performed better than the other big three supermarkets . "" That 5.5 per cent rise ( in underlying sales ) is twice the size of Sainsbury 's ( growth ) , "" said Mr Fowler . Overall sales in the UK rose 11.6 per cent , against 10.9 in the previous quarter . Mr Higginson said 3.7 per cent of that growth came from new stores . Price deflation was 1.6 per cent as Tesco kept cutting prices . Growth in non-food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double-digits . Non-food accounted for half of all new space in the UK . Tesco , which has been expanding its non-food offer aggressively , said sales of non-food product accounted for about 6.5 per cent of group sales . Mr Higginson also said Tesco planned to open four more non-food Tesco stores and was "" sensibly cautious but confident "" about Christmas . He also said the international business was "" slightly ahead "" of expectations , with sales up 16 per cent at constant exchange rates . The shares fell 3 3/4p to 309p . Tesco also said it was relaxed about the fact that the Office of Fair Trading was considering whether to refer the grocery market to the Competition Commission . Mr Higginson said he was confident any further investigation would find that the industry and Tesco was competitive and worked in the interests of consumers . Tesco will report its Christmas trading on December 17 .",tesco feels effect of weaker consumer confidence general retailers
13-06-2011,625,"Tesco forecasts UK sales rebound general retailers Tesco , Britain 's biggest supermarket chain by market share , is expected to move back into growth in its home market , when it reports sales figures this Tuesday , providing an early boost to new chief executive Philip Clarke . JPMorgan Cazenove , joint broker to Tesco , forecasts sales growth from UK stores open at least a year , excluding fuel and VAT , of 0.5-0.6 per cent in the 13 weeks to May 28 . This is an improvement on the final quarter of the 2010-2011 financial year , when like-for-like sales fell by 0.7 per cent . Supermarkets enjoyed a bounce in trade in April , as sales were lifted by unusually warm weather , a string of bank holidays and the Royal Wedding . According to Kantar Worldpanel , the consumer research group , the UK grocery market grew by 7.8 per cent in the four weeks to May 15 . Tesco was the fastest growing of the big four supermarkets during the period , expanding sales by 10.5 per cent . However , retailers and analysts suggest that trading had returned to a more subdued level in May . Mr Clarke said on the sidelines of an industry conference last week that May was "" very much quieter "" and that conditions had returned to a "" more normal level "" after a "" terrific "" April . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , said : "" Like the Duke of York - he took the guys up to the top of the hill , and he brought them down again - trading in May has been pretty subdued again . "" It is probably better than it was in March , but still materially lower than it was in April . "" J Sainsbury is also due to report its first-quarter sales on Wednesday . Mr Black forecasts like-for-like sales growth of 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent , excluding fuel but including VAT , also an improvement on the 1 per cent growth in the 10 weeks to March 19 . VAT tends to account for about 0.8 percentage points . Sainsbury has also been extending a number of stores , which could flatter its sales figures . The supermarkets are expected to remain cautious given the likely slowdown in May , and continued pressure on the high street . One analyst suggested that with food prices still rising , volumes remained negative across the industry . Meanwhile , conditions remain tough when it comes to sales of non-food items , such as electricals . Last week , Home Retail raised fresh alarm over the state of the high street , with sales from Argos stores open at least a year down almost 10 per cent in the 13 weeks to May 28 . "" Trade has been poor in the last month , "" said one retail executive . "" Everyone has had a tough time , whether it 's the supermarkets or the department stores . Everyone is finding recent trading difficult . "" Meanwhile , supermarkets ' sales are being stretched more thinly because of a dash to open new stores across the UK .

9-12-2009,627,"Tesco gears up for a new year of price cutting Fierce price cutting among Britain 's supermarkets will last well into the new year , Tesco has forecast , with shoppers likely to escape the full force of a planned increase in value added tax . The country 's biggest retailer , which reported an unexpected slowdown in sales growth in the past three months , said yesterday it was looking closely at whether to pass on the higher rate of VAT to customers . But Laurie McIlwee , finance director , played down the prospect of higher prices on January 1 , when the government is expected to revert VAT from 15 per cent to 17.5 per cent . "" Given the amount of promotional activity . . . and price competition that is out there , I do n't think there will be a material change in pricing in January , certainly not enough to upset consumer confidence , "" he said . Mr McIlwee warned the Treasury against raising VAT any further and extending the tax to food , which he said would hit spending on the high street . "" Just when consumers are starting to get a bit more confident , to start to indirectly tax them would not be a good thing , "" he said . Shares in Tesco tumbled 2.3 per cent to 425.45p after it reported UK sales growth from stores open at least a year of 2.8 per cent , slightly below the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters . The slowdown from 3.1 per cent growth in the three months to the end of August came even though Tesco doubled rewards under its loyalty scheme . Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , said in October that Tesco was catching up with , and even eclipsing , rivals in UK total and like-for-like sales growth . However , Mr McIlwee was more cautious yesterday . "" I would not say we are trending ahead . We are well in the pack , "" he said . Industry data showed that Tesco had the lowest growth of the big four supermarkets . Mr McIlwee defended the company 's performance , which he said reflected an end to recent increases in food prices . Recent higher sales figures from some of Tesco 's rivals still included the effects of higher food price inflation , he said . Competition was intense in the run-up to Christmas , with promotional activity at an "" unprecedented level "" . Tesco expects its customers to make more use of Clubcard vouchers . Sir Terry said yesterday that consumer confidence was improving , while Mr McIlwee said demand had risen for non-food items , including toys , clothing , electrical goods , music and games .

The supermarket group has suffered several downgrades to profit forecasts as a result of restrictions imposed on big retailers ' store opening hours in South Korea , which are expected to hit its sales and profits . These international pressures come at a delicate time for Tesco , which issued its first profit warning in 20 years in January after the worst performance from its UK business in decades . Now analysts are questioning its prospects overseas . "" Whereas we see steady progress in stabilising the UK , we have growing worries about the financial performance outside the core chain , largely due to factors beyond Tesco 's control , "" said Clive Black at Shore Capital . JPMorgan Cazenove and Nomura , both brokers to Tesco , have each cut their forecasts of Tesco 's pre-tax profit this year , excluding property profits , by 2 per cent to about pound(s)3.5bn - reflecting a pound(s)70m reduction in profits from Korea . Tesco said : "" Our international business contributed pound(s)1.1bn profits to Tesco last year . We have already built market leading positions in many countries and our businesses around the world give us significant opportunities for long-term growth . "" Last month , Mr Clarke called the restrictions in Korea "" not helpful for our biggest business outside of the home market "" . Mr Black noted that the group faced other pressures outside its UK heartland , including a sharp slowdown in sales growth at Fresh & Easy , its lossmaking US business . He has cut his forecast of Tesco 's pre-tax profit excluding property profits this year by 5.6 per cent to pound(s)3.35bn , to reflect lower expectations for Korea , the US , central Europe and the UK . At the same time , Mr Black has raised his forecast of losses at Fresh & Easy by pound(s)13m to pound(s)103.3m for this year . With losses of pound(s)52.3m forecast for the year to February 2014 , this would take Fresh & Easy 's cumulative losses to more than pound(s)800m . At Tesco 's annual meeting last month , Mr Clarke said he remained committed to Fresh & Easy , but acknowledged that if there were no prospect of turning it round Tesco would look at withdrawal from the US .

In a 136-page research report , Lehman Brothers , which replaced Merrill Lynch as broker in March , said the growth of Tesco 's Asian and European operations would drive the company 's share price toward 734p by 2011-12 . "" On our recent visit to South Korea , Thailand and China - which industry analysts last saw in 2004 - we examined the business first hand and the significant potential that these countries possess to enhance Tesco 's value in the next five years , "" analyst Matthew Truman said , as he upgraded to "" overweight "" . In 2012 , Mr Truman expects Tesco 's overseas division to generate sales of Pounds 24bn and earnings before interest and tax of Pounds 1.23bn. To put that figure in context , J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison combined are expected to generate underlying earnings of just more than Pounds 1bn in 2008 . Tesco shares closed 4.4 per cent higher at 433 1/2p , while Sainsbury climbed 2.4 per cent at 557p amid talk that the board of the food retailer was poised to allow Delta Two , the investment vehicle backed by the State of Qatar , access to its books .

A proposed change to liquor laws in California , the hub of Tesco 's Fresh and Easy division , could mark "" the beginning of the end "" for the lossmaking chain , MF Global analysts said . A bill proposed by California Democrat Fiona Ma would ban sales of alcohol at self-service checkouts . Tesco has 126 stores in California , accounting for nearly three-quarters of its US portfolio , and was the only grocer in the state to use self-service tills , MF analyst Mike Dennis noted . Adding the extra staff needed to handle liquor sales would put more pressure on profit margins , which were already very weak because of high fixed costs and a reliance on discount vouchers , Mr Dennis said .

30-06-2010,635,"Tesco issue signals returning appetite for mortgage bonds Tesco , the supermarket group , is to raise pound(s)950m ( $1.4bn ) from issuing bonds against 41 of its supermarkets in the largest form of securitised debt raising since the downturn in property and debt markets began three years ago . This marks the first UK commercial mortgage-backed security transaction this year in a further sign that capital markets are more readily accepting forms of real-estate debt after the shocks of the past recession . This is the fourth such deal in the past 18 months for Tesco , which has been proactive in using the capital markets to raise money from its properties . In total , Tesco has raised about pound(s)2bn . Moody 's , the ratings agency , gave the new 30-year bonds an A3 rating . Goldman Sachs and HSBC are advising . The Tesco bonds are classed as commercial mortgage backed securities ( CMBS ) , although are barely recognisable to the sort of securitised debt transactions being structured during the boom years of the property market . The deal is more akin to corporate bond issuance given that default risk is , in effect , at a company level , in spite of it being backed by the income from the properties of the supermarket chain . As such , the bonds are seen as very safe , and are likely to be bought by pension funds . Bankers in the sector refer to "" true "" CMBS as transactions where there are a number of tranches of bonds offering degrees of risk and return . They say there is not the investor appetite yet for such higher risk assets at the returns on offer given the uncertainty and continued rate of loan defaults in the market . But many say it is only a matter of time before the more complex structured products return to the market . There has been a growing number of necessary restructuring of vehicles created during the boom years of the European CMBS market , with Four Seasons , the care home chain , this week offering holders of pound(s)600m of bonds secured against its property portfolio on unusually attractive terms to encourage them to agree to an extension of its debt . Analysts said the proposal on the two-year loan extension went way beyond previous restructurings in the terms offered , which could set a precedent for future restructurings . There are a number of other restructuring talks , including the pound(s)535m Tahiti loan of 61 Holiday Inn hotels and the EUR1.2bn ( $1.5bn ) Fleet Street Finance 2 transaction that backs a portfolio of department stores in Germany .

Interim results on Wednesday revived worries that the main drag on the retailer 's earnings and cash flow was unprofitable expansion , rather than repair work following its profit warning in January . Citigroup highlighted a 22 per cent drop in Tesco 's net operating cash flow for the first half , a trend the management blamed in part on timing issues with working capital . The company has also emphasised its strategy of recruiting staff and fixing service levels to undo years of underinvestment . But Citi blamed the earnings slump on Tesco 's expansion programme , which it said was creating "" adverse sales leverage "" . Investing to add new space in lower-return areas reduced profit margins , which multiplied the drag on cash flow , it said . Citi also reckoned Tesco would have to cut prices - a strategy so far rejected by management . While the big-four grocers all had similar prices , the fast-growing Aldi chain was about 25 per cent cheaper , it said . "" On its current trajectory it seems likely to us that Tesco will , within a few years , have stopped growing space to a meaningful extent , "" said Citi . "" It would also be forced to cut prices .

At a group level , sales and profits in the six months to the end of August were all heading in the right direction , driven by a recovery in many of Tesco 's international markets in central Europe and in Asia . Indeed , Sir Terry was able to reveal a 12.5 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profit to pound(s)1.6bn , on sales excluding VAT up 7.1 per cent to pound(s)29.8bn , as economies recovered in Asia and Europe . Underlying profit , which excludes exceptional items and goodwill amortisation , rose 14.1 per cent to pound(s)1.79bn. Earnings per share jumped 14 per cent from 12.93p to 14.72p , and the interim dividend is lifted 12.3 per cent to 4.37p. Sir Terry , who retires in March , was also able to announce a fall in net debt , which has worried some analysts , from pound(s)9.5bn a year ago to pound(s)7.6bn , with net borrowings expected to fall to pound(s)7bn at the year end . He said : "" The headwinds of global recession [ have ] become the tailwinds of recovery . We are delivering improving sales and momentum from our international business . "" But scratch a little deeper and the performance was less polished . Tesco surprised the market with the revelation that it was mothballing 13 US stores . One analyst said this was highly unusual , although Sir Terry said it was not unprecedented . Phil Clarke , who takes over as chief executive from Sir Terry in March , said Tesco had been forced to close the stores because populations had dwindled in parts of the western US hit by the housing market downturn . "" Whenever you plan to open stores , you work on the basis that there are going to be people living nearby , "" he said . Tesco will try to sublet the mothballed stores - six in Arizona , six in Nevada and one in inland California - while staff and shopfittings will be redeployed . Its projections assume that it will open them again in the next four to five years . Losses at Fresh & Easy , which will have about 165 stores after the mothballing , increased from pound(s)85m to pound(s)95m in the first half , reflecting the cost of acquiring the operations of two suppliers . Sir Terry denied that closing the stores was a blow to his American dream . In fact , he announced a step up in the store opening programme in the more established population centres . Tesco currently opens one store every two weeks . This will move to one a week towards the end of this year , before increasing to two a week . In 2011 , it will also move into northern California . It is aiming to have about 400 stores by 2012-13 , at which point Tesco forecasts the chain will break even . This is two years earlier than Clive Black , of Shore Capital and one of the most upbeat analysts on Tesco , had been expecting . "" This is a pleasant and important surprise , "" he said . But Mike Dennis , analyst at MF Global , said the US expansion plan looked ambitious , given the rate of openings so far . "" The US is still a big issue , "" he said . But the US is not the only area to trouble some Tesco-watchers . In the UK , sales from stores open at least a year , excluding VAT and petrol , rose 0.3 per cent in the first half . This was made up of 0.1 per cent growth in the first quarter and 0.4 per cent growth in the second . Mr Dennis estimates that if sales paid for by Clubcard vouchers were excluded , first-half UK like-for-like sales would have fallen 0.1 per cent . He forecasts that rival J Sainsbury will on Wednesday report first-half UK like-for-like sales growth of 1.6 per cent . Sir Terry said this comparison was "" not really a concern "" for Tesco . "" We have continued to outperform the industry , "" he insisted . He said the first quarter had been particularly tough because of moderating food price inflation and an increase in petrol prices , which ate into the household budget . "" We will see things pick up a little bit in the autumn , "" he said . "" It 's as if people are having to cap the cash amount they spend because of the extra petrol costs , but what they are buying says they are in the mood to spend a bit more money . "" The roll-out of Tesco 's first banking product is also imminent , as Sir Terry begins his assault to become the "" people 's bank "" . The success of the move will be crucial to the group 's growth ambitions in its home market . Meanwhile , Tesco and its rivals are adding new supermarkets apace , at the same time as the outlook for consumers becomes more uncertain . Britain faces a raft of austerity measures as the government seeks to bring down Britain 's borrowing burden . But Tesco shrugged off the impact , a stance that surprised some analysts . "" They are necessary measures and our business will grow well through it , "" said Laurie McIlwee , finance director . With Tesco also facing the biggest management transition in 14 years , investors will be hoping its confidence in the business proves right . Standing down Sir Terry Leahy , who presented his last set of results as chief executive of Tesco , was silent about his plans when he steps down in March from the role he has held for the past 14 years , writes Andrea Felsted . He refused to say what approaches he had received . However , he said he had no plans to become a non-executive director of a FTSE 100 company , pointing out that he held no such positions at the moment . "" I would not enjoy it , "" he said of such a role . He will also not work as a consultant for Tesco , but he says he will remain the group 's "" biggest fan "" . He has been suggested as a potential candidate for the role of chairman of the BBC Trust , the sovereign body of the BBC . Sir Terry said that he would consider the role if he were asked , but that he did not expect to be approached . He will still be involved in business but this is likely to be in the private arena , potentially as a "" business angel "" , investing in and advising small companies . He will also continue with charity work . On the brink of retirement , he launched a strong defence of final salary pension schemes , which Tesco still operates , albeit with benefits based on career-average salaries . "" It 's a great savings vehicle for the future , and I think people will look back and say it was a great error to allow so many of these schemes to go by the wayside .

18-04-2013,643,"Tesco pays a heavy price for lessening Leahy 's legacy Philip Clarke was in buoyant mood yesterday for a chief executive who has just announced the worst full-year pre-tax profit decline in Tesco 's history . But cutting loose from historic legacies always brings a sense of relief , as many Britons would concur in the aftermath of Margaret Thatcher 's funeral . The bequest from which Mr Clarke is unburdening himself comes from predecessor Sir Terry Leahy . First , Mr Clarke squashed for good any expectations of imperialist growth in store numbers , impairing by pound(s)804m the value of sites that will now never be developed . In consequence , the sale-and-leasebacks that generated pound(s)3bn in profits from the mid-1990s will no longer support earnings . Second , Mr Clarke confirmed Tesco 's disposal of stale and weary US operation Fresh & Easy for a non-cash cost of pound(s)1bn , though he should have pulled the plug on handover two years ago . A third Leahy legacy can not be written off . It is the expectation of steady expansion . But Mr Clarke has at least attempted to confine this to a range : mid single-digit trading profit growth delivering a return of 12 to 15 per cent on capital , which will be invested at a rate of 3.5 to 4 per cent of sales . The doctrines handed down from Dear Leader Leahy offer little useful guidance in meeting these targets . The world has changed since he stood down , with retail demand diffusing by osmosis to the internet . One response from Mr Clarke is to buy such groovy start-ups as video streaming company Blinkbox . He hopes the entrepreneurs injected into Tesco through these deals will become "" intrapreneurs "" , agents of change who will shake up the business from within . The upfront costs have so far been small . The cultural implications are bigger . The outcomes are hard to call . But as Mr Clarke seeks to put his stamp on Tesco , he should beware of replacing Leahy-era white elephants with follies of his own . jonathan.guthrie@ft.com Credit : By Jonathan Guthrie",tesco pays a heavy price for lessening leahy's legacy
20-04-2009,645,"Tesco poised to make profits history Tesco is expected to make corporate history on Tuesday by being the first UK retailer to announce profits in excess of pound(s)3bn , but celebrations are likely to be short-lived , writes Samantha Pearson . While the group remains Britain 's biggest supermarket chain , it has been gradually losing market share in the downturn as its rivals lure customers with recession-friendly discounts . Investors will therefore be awaiting evidence in the full-year results that Tesco 's attempts to adapt its offering through monitoring customer spending have helped to maintain UK sales growth . Expected heavy trading losses in the US market are likely to bring the group 's US chain , Fresh & Easy , under scrutiny again and operations in Ireland and central Europe could cause concern given the severity of the recession in these regions . The other talking point will be Tesco 's net debt , which although still manageable is likely to exceed the group 's previous target of pound(s)8bn and could stunt short-term store growth . Tesco , however , is likely to reassure long-term investors with promising performance from its recent acquisition in South Korea and words of encouragement on its new initiative to introduce 30 in-store banks this year . Pre-tax profits are forecast at just more than pound(s)3bn from expected revenues of pound(s)53.5bn , according to consensus analyst estimates from Thomson Reuters .",tesco poised to make profits history

Tesco has lost more key UK customers in the past year than any of its rivals , according to a survey from Morgan Stanley . While 78 per cent of people surveyed had shopped at Tesco in the past 12 months , those using the grocer for their main shop had fallen from 40 per cent last year to 36 per cent . "" Tesco is losing loyal shoppers but not yet taking steps to tackle their biggest area of concern - price , "" said the broker . Since its profit warning in January , Tesco has set out to revive UK sales by investing in store refits , staffing and improved product ranges . But customer perceptions of value for money have continued to deteriorate and the majority want improvements in pricing , said Morgan Stanley . Tesco fell 1.6 per cent to 304.5p , taking its loss this year to 25 per cent . Morgan Stanley repeated "" underweight "" advice in a note sent to clients overnight . The wider market pared initial gains to leave the FTSE 100 up by 4.81 points , or 0.1 per cent , at 5,356.34 by the close . A holiday in the US meant blue-chip volume was down 45 per cent on the recent average . IAG , the British Airways and Iberia owner , lost a further 2.7 per cent to 137.1p on expectations that Bankia was preparing to sell its 12.05 per cent stake as part of a recapitalisation effort . The bank said over the weekend that it would give details of stake sales next month when the lender delivered its strategic plan . BP fell 1.9 per cent to 399.7p following the resignation of Mikhail Fridman , TNK-BP chief executive and chairman . The news revived fears about whether BP could remain part of the Russian joint venture , which provides about a quarter of its production . B&Q owner Kingfisher lost 1.8 per cent to 274.9p ahead of first-quarter results due Thursday , which were widely expected to disappoint because of inclement April weather . "" We expect like-for-like sales in the UK will be the worst Kingfisher has reported in at least the last decade , "" said Bernstein Research . Among the gainers , Kesa Electricals rose 3 per cent to 49.1p after activist investor Knight Vinke raised its stake above 25 per cent with the purchase of just over 1m shares . Argos owner Home Retail Group rose 0.5 per cent to 77.5p after Terry Duddy , chief executive , bought 160,000 shares at 76.87p each . Capita was up 3 per cent to 629p after UBS added the outsourcer to its "" buy "" list . Two years of declining organic revenue and increased acquisitions had weighed on returns and pushed the stock 's valuation to an all-time low , said UBS . "" Analysis of [ Capita 's ] largest recent acquisitions has given us comfort regarding the quality of the businesses acquired , the financial dynamics and , most importantly , their clear links to attractive and growing markets . "" Packaging maker Rexam rose 2.1 per cent to 400.7p , awaiting the sale of its personal care division , which is expected this week . Private equity funds Sun European Partners and Oaktree Capital were said to be frontrunners for the business , which analysts have valued at about pound(s)350m . "" We would expect Rexam to clarify the use of proceeds upon announcing the transaction , "" said Merrill Lynch , which repeated "" buy "" advice . "" If we assume pound(s)250m-300m is returned , this equates to 7 per cent - 9 per cent of the market capitalisation , in addition to Rexam 's recurring 3.5-4.0 per cent dividend yield .

Essar Energy dropped 4.9 per cent to 109p after Morgan Stanley said results next month from the Indian power company may disappoint . Unless the group is cleared to begin coal mining , it may have to delay the commissioning of its Mahan power station again , said Morgan Stanley .

5-10-2009,649,"Tesco puts ad muscle behind US business general retailers ; Speculation of expansion plans Tesco has embarked on the first significant advertising campaign for its Fresh & Easy stores as it fights to make a success of its foray into the US . The media advertising campaign , based on the premise that Fresh & Easy can save customers money by keeping things simple , follows initial leafleting to attract shoppers to the stores in southern California , Nevada and Arizona . People familiar with the situation said that with about 125 stores , launching a significant campaign now made sense . Others suggested that Tesco , Britain 's biggest retailer , had chosen to go ahead because of signs of stability in the US economy . However , the campaign for the US operation , of which former Tesco marketing executive Tim Mason is chief executive , is likely to rekindle speculation that Tesco is gearing up to start expanding the lossmaking US chain again , after its assault on northern California was put on hold . Tesco has invested in sites in northern California , while it has completed work on the structure of a distribution depot in an industrial park in Stockton that it will use to service new northern California stores when they open . The supermarket chain is set to face questions on its progress in the US when it reports interim results tomorrow . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , is forecasting losses from Fresh & Easy of about pound(s)80m ( $127.4m ) in the six months to August 22 . Tesco will also be under pressure to show that its UK underlying sales performance is catching up with faster growing rivals , as it is lagging behind Asda , J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison in UK like-for-like sales growth . Investors and analysts will be particularly keen to see how successful a recent revamp of Tesco 's Clubcard loyalty scheme has been . The market will also look for progress on cutting borrowings . Net debt ballooned to pound(s)9.6bn at the end of the year to February 28 . But according to Mr Black , Tesco should "" hopefully be able to say that they are through the eye of the storm "" . He forecasts first half pre-tax profit of pound(s)1.57bn. Investors and analysts will also be keen for an update on Tesco 's aggressive expansion in financial services , after it pledged to offer current accounts and mortgages within the next two years . Among the other leading UK retailers , J Sainsbury is due to report second-quarter sales on Wednesday , with the consensus of analysts ' forecasts for a 5.5 per cent increase in like-for-like sales , down from 7.8 per cent in the first quarter , amid falling food price inflation .

But Tesco , the UK 's largest super-market group , was not among the laggards . It was quick to embrace the internet as an alternative channel for its business and began trialling online shopping in 1996 . Tesco says its website , launched in 1999 , is now the world 's most popular online grocer with 120,000 orders a week . In the last financial year , Tesco 's online sales accounted for just less than two per cent - Pounds 577m - of total group sales of Pounds 33.5bn. But this year - Tesco announces its year-end results on April 12 - it is thought that the retailer 's internet sales will have grown strongly after a buoyantChristmas . Tesco will not disclose how much it has invested in its online offering but says the website , which sells hundreds of thousands of products , broke even in 2002 . In the six months to August 14 online sales were up 27 per cent at Pounds 307m , while pre-tax profit was at Pounds 15m .

It has also emerged that Jan Marchant , a senior executive in the group 's clothing business , has left Britain 's biggest supermarket group by sales . Moody 's said it had cut Tesco 's long-term senior unsecured rating by one notch from A3 to Baa1 because the pound(s)1bn plan would weigh on earnings . "" It will take time for Tesco to reap the benefits of the measures it has announced in order to revive profit growth in its key UK market to levels seen in previous years , especially in the current unfavourable environment which will not support Tesco 's sales growth , "" said Yasmina Serghini-Douvin , senior analyst at Moody's .

Laurie McIlwee , finance director , also revealed that Tesco would not enter into contracts to purchase stock a long way in the future , or place big orders , until there was more certainty in the eurozone . "" You would not go long on any contract with any kind of supplier , so everything in the market is becoming much more short-term , "" he said . Mr McIlwee said Tesco had reduced currency exposure and already raised the money in the bond markets to pay off a EUR1.5bn eurobond maturing in September next year . The company already had the cash in the bank ready , he added , because it did not want to take the risk of credit markets seizing up . If it had not been possible to refinance this bond "" we would have [ had ] to cut back our own capital expenditure "" , he said . "" It is not a shock that you want to face . "" Mr McIlwee added : "" Any business has to take seriously the disruption in the eurozone . "" However , he stressed that Tesco was largely focused on countries in central Europe outside the single currency area . The comments came as Tesco revealed that its programme of pound(s)500m of price cuts launched in September had failed to improve sales at its UK stores that had been open for at least a year . UK like-for-like sales , excluding fuel and VAT , fell by 0.9 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 26 , compared with the year earlier period , similar to the preceding quarter . Mr McIlwee defended the performance , saying that the volume of goods sold in the third quarter rose by about 1 percentage point , outperforming the market by about 2 percentage points in terms of volume , according to industry data . But it had also shown that Tesco 's average price per item was falling , meaning less money was going through its tills . "" Big Price Drop is not a promotion , or a quick fix .

Ocado , the internet-only start-up that sells Waitrose food , scored highest with an 82 per cent customer satisfaction rating , while Tesco , which is by far the biggest internet grocer , delivering 320,000 orders a week compared with 100,000 for Sainsbury , had a 58 per cent rating , closely followed by Asda 's 59 per cent . Nearly half of all the shoppers who had bought groceries online were sent the wrong items , with 45 per cent reporting that at least one item of their last shop was substituted for another product . One shopper taking part ordered vanilla ice cream but was sent a vanilla air freshener instead . Tesco said that the survey did not reflect "" the reality we experience with customer feedback from some of our 1m regular online shoppers "" . The supermarket said : "" They love our unrivalled delivery area , our cheaper alternative suggestions , bagless deliveries , convenient delivery times and efficient service with a 95 per cent time-slot success rate . "" All the biggest food chains , bar Wm Morrison , have been pushing aggressively into online shopping as more consumers switch to the internet in order to buy groceries . Asda , which was relatively late into the service compared with Tesco and Sainsbury , said this month that it was planning to open a "" virtual store "" in its Yorkshire heartlands dedicated to fulfilling online orders . Retailers typically pick internet orders from the aisles of local stores and then pack them into vans for delivery . But they are now having to open internet-only stores in busy areas to make sure they can meet deliveries . Tesco opened one such store in Croydon , south London , two years ago .

19-01-2012,671,"Tesco starts sales fightback with new voucher campaign Promotion similar to scheme by Asda Tesco is fighting back with a new voucher campaign to kick-start its performance , just days after the company 's chief executive admitted its pound(s)500m flagship price-cutting programme had been undermined by rivals ' coupon promotions . Last week Tesco reported its worst domestic sales performance for decades and issued its first profit warning in 20 years , after its "" Big Price Drop "" failed to revive sales over the Christmas and new year trading period . The group 's newest offer is that if shoppers spend pound(s)40 in-store this week , they will receive a pound(s)5 voucher for next week 's shop of more than pound(s)40 . The promotion is similar to one Asda was running before Christmas , when it offered the same deal to customers if they checked their prices through its "" Asda Price Guarantee "" scheme . In that scheme , Asda pledges to be 10 per cent cheaper than its rivals or it will refund the difference . Tesco described its voucher offer as another way for customers to save money and said the "" Big Price Drop "" , which it launched in September , was still running . The move comes after Philip Clarke , chief executive , blamed a ferocious fightback from rival supermarkets for the 2.3 per cent decline in Tesco 's UK sales from stores open at least a year , as its big competitors bombarded customers with vouchers and coupons . "" There was a lot of promotional couponing going on around Christmas , "" Mr Clarke said when the profit warning was announced last Thursday . "" That is where we should have gone a little bit harder and we can correct that in the future . "" Asda hit back at Tesco 's move . "" While imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , Tesco 's attempt at imitation misses the point , "" it said . "" Vouchers that promise lower prices instead of delivering them are nothing more than a short-term gimmick . "" It said more than half a million customers were using the Asda Price Guarantee each week . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , said Tesco had been adversely affected not only by Asda 's vouchers but also by J Sainsbury 's pledge to match rivals on a basket of branded goods or refund the difference , as well as significant promotional activity by Tesco 's other rivals .

5-12-2005,673,"Tesco starts telecoms challenge Tesco is to compete with high street telecommunications specialists by opening up dedicated "" telecoms centres "" . The retailer 's flagship store in Slough will today host the first of such centres , providing customers with mobile handsets , landlines and accessories as well as advice on broadband and home phone services . Tesco is the largest UK retailer - over the past five years it has captured more than half the growth in the grocery market - and its latest foray may alarm high street telecoms chains such as Carphone Warehouse . Andy Dewhurst , chief executive at Tesco telecoms , said : "" This is not just another mobile phone shop . At Tesco we are challenging the normal telecoms buying experience , which is complicated , pressured and time-consuming . "" Staff will not be paid on a commission basis to avoid the problems of pressure selling , he added . Tesco is introducing new services such as the "" mobile phone selector "" where customers type in their mobile phone requirements and are then given the most suitable handset options . The launch of the centre in Slough is the first of a number of stores across the country that will see Tesco telecoms test a range of formats . Last month the retailer showed it was not immune to weakening consumer confidence as it reported the first slowdown in underlying sales growth for two years . Tesco , which has a 30.2 per cent share of supermarket shopping in the UK , has performed better than the other big three supermarkets . Overall sales in the UK rose 11.6 per cent in the third quarter . The company said 3.7 per cent of that growth came from new stores . Price deflation was 1.6 per cent as Tesco kept cutting prices . Growth in non-food sales was below the 13 per cent reported in the last quarter but still in double-digits . Non-food accounted for half of all new space in the UK . Tesco , which has been expanding its non-food offer , said such sales accounted for about 6.5 per cent of group sales . The retailer plans to open four more non-food Tesco stores .",tesco starts telecoms challenge

Britain 's largest retailer delivered stronger headline growth than its competitors for the fifth year running . However , the market , which has become used to Tesco significantly outperforming its rivals , gave a lukewarm response to the figures , which showed under-lying sales up 5.7 per cent in the seven weeks to January 7 with volumes up 7.2 per cent . Andrew Fowler , analyst at Merrill Lynch , Tesco 's house broker , said the numbers showed that the retailer "" whilst firmly good is no longer exceptional "" . The shares closed 1.8 per cent lower at 312 1/ 4p . They have underperformed the food retailing sector by 3.3 per cent since their recent low in October . Andy Higginson , Tesco finance director , said he was delighted with the performance . "" We have had two huge Christmases . With like- for-like volumes up 7.2 per cent , to have held these gains and to have seen no switching back ( by customers ) to Sainsbury 's , we are really pleased . "" J Sainsbury showed a 5.2 per cent rise in underlying sales in the third quarter . Asked whether Tesco was concerned about Sainsbury 's nascent revival , Mr Higginson said : "" We are worried about everyone but we have been here before and you have to measure these things over time . "" Merrill said in a note that it thought Sainsbury had beaten Tesco on an underlying basis over the festive period , given that Tesco 's like-for-like figure had been inflated by store extensions and maturing new space . "" On identical space , Sainsbury 's like-for-like gain will have been better than Tesco 's for the first time in a very long time , "" Mr Fowler wrote . Tesco 's total sales over the period grew 11.5 per cent against 12.1 per cent last year . It said the internet performance had been particularly strong as it took 1.75m orders , equivalent to Pounds 1.5m of turnover , and also singled out home entertainment , clothing and its Finest food range as strong sellers . Mr Higginson said he expected the UK retail market to remain tough , with the trends of price deflation and rising costs continuing . Tesco said price deflation stood at 1.5 per cent over the seven weeks . "" People will carry on being cautious . While prices are going down for food , the cost of filling your car and fuel bills at home are all going up and so people will be feeling the pinch . "" The international business , which accounts for just over one- fifth of profits , had a slowdown in sales , which rose 16.1 per cent over the period .

16-01-2008,677,"Tesco struggles in UK By ELIZABETH RIGBY and MAGGIE URRY Tesco said yesterday it was feeling the effects of the consumer slowdown in its home market as Britain 's biggest retail chain failed to match up to sales expectations . Tesco said conditions had been more difficult over Christmas , but it enjoyed a 3.1 per cent lift in underlying sales - against expectations of 4-4.5 per cent - in the six weeks to January 5 . "" We had a good Christmas , "" said Andrew Higginson , finance director . "" We have been affected by the market the same as anyone else . . . Most people would give their right arm for these types of numbers . "" Mr Higginson said the overseas business - which stretches from the US to China - offered resilience against a softening in the UK . He said central Europe had delivered a 30 per cent sales uplift . Overall the international business , which now accounts for nearly a quarter of group sales and a fifth of profits , enjoyed sales growth of 26.9 per cent . The IGD , the food research body , said yesterday that it expected Tesco 's international turnover to increase by Pounds 30bn ( Dollars 59bn ) to Pounds 74bn by 2012 . But it was the UK performance that captured the market 's attention yesterday as the shares dropped 3 per cent on the disappointing trading figures . Retail stocks have been some of the worst performers in the FTSE over the past two weeks as a glut of poor trading statements have stoked wider concerns about the outlook for 2008 . Tesco said it still wanted to see a cut in UK interest rates and played down talk of food price inflation , saying that deflation in non-food items had offset any gains in food to keep inflation steady at 1 per cent . "" The consumer is under a lot of pressure . We think the Bank of England has misread the situation quite a bit over the past year , pushing rates up too fast , "" Mr Higginson said . He said the newly opened Fresh & Easy chain of 28 stores Tesco had set up in southern California , Las Vegas and Phoenix had seen a "" very encouraging "" response from shoppers : while the decision by Wal- Mart to open a similar style of smaller shops in the area was "" the sincerest form of flattery "" .

3-10-2013,679,"Tesco struggles to spin all plates News analysis ; Chief executive says that the overhaul in the UK is starting to work , writes Andrea Felsted At a press briefing to unveil Tesco 's joint venture in China , Frank Lai , finance director of China Resources Enterprise , was keen to praise his new partner . "" What we can learn from Tesco : how to do the retail business the right way , "" he said . Investors in Britain 's biggest retailer may well disagree . Over the past two years , Tesco has lurched from one crisis to another . After a pound(s)1bn investment in the UK to counteract dismal domestic trading , and deals to exit the US and partially China , the retailer is now fighting another fire in central Europe , where profits have collapsed . "" Just when you thought they were coming to the point when all the plates were spinning without falling off , one drops and it smashes all over the place , "" said Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital . After its first profit warning in 20 years in January 2012 , Tesco set out plans to overhaul the UK , and chief executive Philip Clarke said this was beginning to work . Sales from UK stores open at least a year were flat on the year-earlier period in the three months to the end of August , compared with a 1 per cent decline in the preceding quarter . "" The UK business is getting stronger , and we are starting to see that coming through in the numbers . But this is not yet translating into a better overall performance because of the challenges we face internationally , "" Mr Clarke said . Indeed , trading profit in central Europe slumped 70 per cent to pound(s)55m , compared with analysts ' forecasts of about pound(s)130m . This led some analysts to question why Tesco had not signalled the scale of the collapse earlier . Laurie McIlwee , finance director , defended the handling of the situation . "" We have invested a lot in the second quarter in Poland , nearly pound(s)20m . When you invest in price , quality , service and range , you do n't get the immediate uplift , "" he said . The performance in Europe - which includes the Republic of Ireland operation - was also hit by an unexpected worsening of conditions in Ireland , and a deterioration in Turkey . After the deals in the US and China , attention is now focusing on whether Tesco could shed other international operations , in a further dismantling of the global business built by former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy . Turkey is seen as the most obvious candidate . But Mr McIlwee said : "" We are still wedded to Turkey . We think it 's a good opportunity . "" He also said that Tesco remained committed to central Europe , given its strong market positions in the region . But Mr Clarke would not rule out similar ventures to that announced with CRE elsewhere across the international business . According to Mr Black : "" There is a greater probability today of Tesco exiting Turkey . It is much less likely that they would ever consider withdrawing from central Europe . The fact is that conversation ca n't be blindly discounted now , whereas it could have been blindly discounted in the past . "" Meanwhile , although the UK has stabilised , some investors and analysts are concerned about the impact of the discounters , and that Tesco will have to cut prices to take on Aldi , which is expanding aggressively and powering ahead . "" We never say something is forever , but [ the UK operating margin of ] 5.2 per cent is comfortable for us , "" Mr Clarke said . There was one bright spot , however . Mr Clarke revealed that sales of Tesco 's tablet , the Hudl , which went on sale on Monday , were better than forecast , helped by a higher staff discount this week . "" We have sold 35,000 in two days . They have sold a bit better than expected , "" he said . "" So far so good . We are going to be a bit short of stock into next week .

13-01-2012,681,"Tesco suffers hangover from Christmas Profit warning Tesco shares plunged yesterday after the UK retailer issued a profit warning in the wake of disappointing Christmas trading in its UK heartland . In a shift that could signal a turning point in the evolution of the UK retail sector , it also said it was planning to open fewer hypermarkets in the UK and put greater emphasis on online sales . Tesco 's shares , which had been steadily falling ahead of the trading update , slumped nearly 16 per cent to 323 1/2 p in London , wiping as much as pound(s)4.9bn from its market capitalisation . Shares in other UK grocers also fell amid more general nervousness about the sector 's prospects . Philip Clarke , Tesco 's chief executive , said the company had been outgunned by rivals ' promotions in the UK over the holiday period . "" We chose in those critical six weeks not to hit customers with a blizzard of coupons but to invest mainly in cutting prices , "" he said . While he argued this was the right focus in the long term , he conceded it had caused Tesco , the UK 's leading retailer by sales , to underperform in the short term : "" I have got to acknowledge that we backed off a bit on some of our promotional and couponing activity just as everybody else upped it . "" J Sainsbury , one of Tesco 's main rivals , issued a more robust Christmas trading update on Wednesday , aided by a coupon-based promotion . Tesco gave only a glimpse of its plan to open fewer very large stores in the UK than planned . Mr Clarke said its growth ambitions in non-food items could be increasingly satisfied through internet sales rather than building more "" big box "" stores . Sales in the six weeks to January 7 were down 2.3 per cent year-on-year in the UK on a like-for-like basis that strips out new store openings , petrol sales and value added tax . This was weaker than the 0.9 per cent decline posted in the third quarter of its financial year , which ended in November . Analysts had been expecting a decline of 0.9 per cent over the holiday period , according to a poll by Reuters . Mr Clarke said : "" It is not what I wanted for Christmas . "" The trading statement was a "" major disappointment "" , according to analysts at Shore Capital . Tesco said it now expected to deliver "" minimal "" growth in trading profit and underlying pre-tax profit in its next financial year , compared with the 10 per cent growth anticipated by the market . The flat outlook reflected the need to invest hundreds of millions of pounds - particularly in the UK - in price cuts , product improvements and better service , it said .

4-01-2010,683,"Tesco to grapple with plan to expand News analysis ; From the US to banking , the retailer faces some tough challenges ahead , writes Andrea Felsted When Tesco updates the market next week on its Christmas trading , analysts will be looking for signs that a big promotional push in its home market is paying off . But the ferociously competitive UK grocery market is not the only area where Tesco faces a crucial test this year . It is also striving to become "" the people 's bank "" , while it must make a success of its foray into the US . According to Dave McCarthy , analyst at Evolution Securities : "" Tesco has a challenging year ahead , probably its most difficult year in more than a decade as it faces a number of issues on a number of fronts . "" In November 2007 , the group invaded the US grocery market - a venture on which Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive , has staked his reputation . But the Tesco juggernaut has been met with the full force of the global economic downturn , which has hit California , Tesco 's launch market , particularly hard . Tesco has 125 Fresh & Easy stores in southern California , far short of the 500 it had hoped for by February 2010 . Laurie McIlwee , finance director , said recently that there were signs of improvement at Fresh & Easy after the business was relaunched , with sales rising 37.4 per cent in the third quarter , and also stronger like-for-like sales . Consequently , Tesco ex-pects the business to make a loss over the full year close to its $259m ( pound(s)160m ) deficit of last year . According to Michael Dennis , analyst at MF Global , Tesco has invested about $1.4bn in Fresh & Easy . He forecasts that it will have lost about $650m between its launch and February 2010 . Tesco has also put an expansion into northern California on hold but has continued to acquire sites in central to northern California . It is opening four stores in the Fresno area , its most northerly location to date . Lucy Neville-Rolfe , corporate and legal affairs director at Tesco , says the retailer will move further north when it makes sense to do so . "" We did not expect to have the greatest recession since the 1930s . What we have got to do is do the right thing , "" she says . Ms Neville-Rolfe also points out that Tesco , which operates in 14 countries , has international opportunities elsewhere . She is upbeat on Asia , which is coming out of recession more rapidly than other markets . She points to China , which will be a big focus for Tesco this year , and India . The Indian market largely "" missed "" the recession , and Tesco will be the supplier to Star Bazaar , the hypermarket chain of Tata Group 's retail arm , and also plans to open its own cash and carry store this year . Markets in eastern Europe are also improving , Ms Neville-Rolfe says , as is Ireland . Clive Black , analyst at Shore Capital , says economic headwinds are abating , not only in Tesco 's home market , but internationally . "" A year ago the economic wheels were falling off Tesco 's bus , "" he says . "" Now those wheels are back on and , if anything , Tesco is a little bit of a leaner , meaner machine , capable of going faster in terms of paying down debt and focusing on the business . "" But Tesco 's challenges do not end in the US . Another issue facing Tesco is whether it can recapture its poise in the UK grocery market , which accounts for more than two-thirds of its profits and sales . For much of 2009 it lagged behind its main rivals in terms of UK sales growth based on stores open at least a year . In a bid to close the gap , it has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in its Clubcard loyalty scheme , offering customers double points and mailing out pound(s)67m ( $108m ) of vouchers in November , which would normally have been sent in February . In spite of the Clubcard assault , Tesco 's UK likefor-like sales in the three months to the end of November rose by 2.8 per cent , less than expectations . "" It strikes us that either the [ Clubcard ] initiative is n't working or that the underlying business is continuing to underperform , "" said analysts at Morgan Stanley . Ms Neville-Rolfe says : "" I do n't think you should draw that conclusion at all . So far we are pleased . "" Mr McIlwee says Tesco 's third-quarter sales covered a period when spiralling increases in food prices came to an end . Rivals ' figures still included food price inflation . Tesco expects the beefed up Clubcard to have a bigger impact on its Christmas trading . Andrew Kasoulis , analyst at Credit Suisse , is forecasting UK like-for-like sales growth of 3 per cent for the six weeks to January 9 , in line with J Sainsbury for the third quarter . But even a strong performance could prove controversial . Mr McCarthy says : "" There are more than pound(s)100m of extra Clubcard vouchers in circulation against last year . "" If Tesco counts these as cash sales in its Christmas trading statement and treats them as it did in its third-quarter trading statement , it will artificially inflate reported sales by 1 to 2 per cent . "" Tesco has rejected any suggestion of additional Clubcard vouchers artificially inflating sales , and Ms Neville-Rolfe says that if they make an unexpected difference to sales , Tesco will make this clear . She adds that vouchers make no difference to profit . If this were not enough to contend with , Tesco has embarked on an aggressive assault on banking . While banks are bloodied by the financial crisis , retailers are largely unscathed . Therefore Tesco has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to poach their customers . But building a bank is expensive and time consuming . Tesco admitted recently that it would not reach its goal of having 30 in-store branches by the end of 2009 , as it had hoped . It has also revealed that it may not begin offering a current account - the main banking relationship - until 2011 . However , it is being slightly more aggressive on the potential timing of mortgages , which it could launch towards the end of 2010 . "" I do n't think we are slipping , "" says Ms Neville-Rolfe . "" We always said a couple of years . If we were to do mortgages [ in 2010 ] , that would be quicker rather than slower . """,tesco to grapple with plan to expand

Ahead of a trading update this week , Tesco slipped 1.9 per cent to 358.5p. Investec Securities argued that management needed to rein in guidance so that it can keep UK profit margins stable . "" Tesco is not a growth stock , nor is it an income stock and it lacks momentum , "" it said . With sales falling and customers moving online , Tesco 's only option to defend margins is by raising prices , Investec said . But such a strategy would push the grocer "" down the doom loop , not shift it to the virtuous circle "" , it argued . The broker also reckoned its international expansion continued to destroy shareholder value . "" International is a growing problem and after 15 years there is no sign of acceptable returns , "" it said .

However , Mr Higginson - echoing comments made by Stuart Rose , of Marks and Spencer , last month - tried to play down talk of a consumer downturn on the back of the credit squeeze . "" It is hard to make long-term predictions about what will happen in the new year . It varies from month-to-month . At the moment we are delivering good numbers .

However , some hint of a slowdown was evident as Mr Higginson said non-food sales were falling back a little as shoppers held back from buying more indulgent purchases beyond their weekly food shop . Signs of a downturn have yet to show in the headline figures , with underlying UK sales excluding petrol up 4.1 per cent in the 13 weeks to November 24 - ahead of J Sainsbury and Wm Morrison 's latest figures - and group sales up 11.8 per cent . The performance in the UK was well ahead of the first half when Tesco 's underlying growth slowed to 3.5 per cent on the back of the wet summer . UK sales overall were up 7.6 per cent . The update came on the heels of Tesco 's US tour with analysts to show off its new Fresh & Easy chain . Mr Higginson said the 15 stores on the West Coast had got off to a good start . "" You ca n't fault them for effort , "" he said of the executive team in California . "" It is Herculian in that space of time to have built from scratch what they have built . "" Mr Higginson said the discounter model , with high levels of own- brand product , could work in the US where shoppers tend to opt for big brand food items . "" It will be interesting to see how that pans out .

22-05-2008,691,"Tesco victorious in drawn-out fight for Dobbies By TOM BRAITHWAITE and MAGGIE URRY The protracted battle between Britain 's biggest supermarket and Scotland 's richest man looked to have finally gone the way of Tesco after Sir Tom Hunter agreed to sell his stake in Dobbies Garden Centres . Almost a year after Tesco revealed a surprising Pounds 155.6m acquisition attempt , the supermarket group appeared to have its green fingers on the keys of Dobbies , having fought Sir Tom , the retail and property entrepreneur , on the stock market and via the courts . Tesco yesterday announced Sir Tom 's West Coast Capital private equity firm had agreed to accept Pounds 12 a share for its 29.2 per cent stake , giving Tesco 94.7 per cent and allowing it to delist Dobbies . Sir Tom - who controls Wyevale , the UK 's biggest garden centre chain - had accused Dobbies ' board of "" rolling over "" for Tesco 's initial bid last year and subsequently attempted to frustrate the acquisition , resorting to court last week in an unsuccessful bid to block an equity issue that could have diluted his holding . After that route failed , West Coast was left to choose between stumping up Pounds 44m for the equity issue , taking the legal action elsewhere , attempting to buy-out Tesco or bowing out of a 12-month tussle . All options were explored but , with Tesco unwilling to sell to West Coast , the entrepreneur accepted Pounds 36.3m , or Pounds 12 a share - less than Tesco 's Pounds 15 a share offer price last year and much less than the Pounds 18.45 a share maximum price paid by Sir Tom in the market . However , since West Coast started buying at as little as 500p a share it is not expected to have incurred a heavy loss on the investment . Technically , Tesco 's cash offer , which is open to the few hundred small shareholders who have not already sold to the supermarket group , does not yet have a board recommendation , although that should not be too hard to come by . Tesco said : "" The board of directors of Tesco Holding will be seeking a recommendation for the offer from the board of Dobbies . "" Dobbies said it would issue an announcement "" including the board 's advice in relation to the takeover offer . . . in due course "" . Three of the five Dobbies ' board members are Tesco employees ; the garden centre chain 's chairman is Lucy Neville-Rolfe , corporate and legal affairs director at Tesco . After a difficult campaign , Tesco should now succeed in consolidating its first non-food acquisition , which will continue to be run and developed separately under the Dobbies brand name . Given Sir Tom 's already large gardening centre empire , there is likely to be plenty of opportunity for further clashes in the future . Shares in Dobbies fell 17 1/2p to Pounds 11.95.",tesco victorious in drawn-out fight for dobbies
7-03-2013,693,"Tesco wins analyst applause for turnround efforts Tesco rallied to its best level since last year 's profit warning yesterday as analysts backed the group to regain investors ' trust . Improved focus and margin investment have been the first results of chief executive Philip Clarke 's three-year turnround programme , which has put Tesco on a firmer footing , said Shore Capital . Credit Suisse also turned positive on Tesco , which rose 1.6 per cent to 378.2p. The dissenting voice came from Morgan Stanley . Its team worried about legislation in Korea , Tesco 's largest and likely its most profitable overseas market . Korea has been implementing a law passed in 2011 that gives local authorities the power to limit opening hours , said Morgan Stanley . The legislation "" is accelerating the secular shift away from hypermarkets and in favour of convenience stores "" , it said . With hypermarkets making up 92 per cent of Tesco 's Korean floorspace , like-for-like sales in the country may have dropped 8 per cent this year , it said . The wider market stalled at a five-year high , with the FTSE 100 down 4.31 points at 6,427.64. Vodafone added 22 points to the index with a 6.8 per cent gain to 180p . The jump came after Bloomberg reported that Vodafone had been in merger talks with Verizon Communications as recently as December , which had stalled over disagreements on leadership and corporate base . It was now more likely that Verizon would buy at least part of Vodafone 's stake in their Verizon Wireless partnership , with the UK group potentially avoiding capital gains tax by using an accounting method known as a C Reorganisation , Bloomberg said . Car insurer Admiral bounced 5.3 per cent to pound(s)11.34 after its annual earnings and dividend topped expectations . A dividend hike from Legal & General also beat forecasts , lifting its stock 2 per cent to 166p . BSkyB climbed 2.9 per cent to 888.5p after an industry website reported that News Corp was "" to mount another takeover bid "" , citing comments from News Corp chief operating officer Chase Carey to a London media conference . Investors saw little in Mr Carey 's comments to justify the bid hopes . He said News Corp was interested in maximising the value of its 39 per cent stake in BSkyB but stressed that the company was happy to wait for the right opportunity . Imperial Tobacco fell 2.4 per cent to pound(s)23.85 and British American Tobacco was down 1.3 per cent to pound(s)35.19 on fears the UK would make plain packaging compulsory this year .

30-07-2011,697,"The waiting game pays off for Vodafone The waiting game is finally over . Seven years after Vodafone last received a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile phone operator , the UK telecoms group will get a new pay-out in 2012 . And it is not a small dividend . Vodafone , which has a 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless , its joint venture with Verizon Communications , will get a $4.5bn ( pound(s)2.7bn ) pay-out from the US mobile operator in January . Vodafone will respond by paying a pound(s)2bn special dividend to its shareholders in February . The resumption of cash distributions by Verizon Wireless is a coup for Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , and Sir John Bond , the outgoing chairman . They faced down pressure from some shareholders for the UK group to sell its Verizon Wireless stake , instead insisting on playing a waiting game . Why were Mr Colao and Sir John so confident that their patience would be rewarded ? And why did Verizon Wireless ' dividend payments stop in 2005 ? The answers can be found in how the balance of power inside Verizon Wireless has shifted over the years between its two shareholders . The joint venture 's parents have had a tempestuous relationship , but , for the moment at least , Vodafone has come out on top . The $4.5bn payment by Verizon Wireless should increase Vodafone 's free cash flow by at least 30 per cent in 2011-12 . The only real surprise in the announcement late on Thursday that Verizon Wireless would pay a $10bn dividend to its parents in 2012 was the timing . Most investors were expecting a statement at the end of this year , rather than now , but they had long been prepared for a resumption of cash distributions . Verizon Communications , the US telecoms group which owns 55 per cent of Verizon Wireless , has been hinting since the middle of last year that the mobile operator would once again pay dividends . This is because Verizon Communications ' $5.4bn annual dividend could have to be cut unless it starts to tap Verizon Wireless ' cash , according to Robin Bienenstock , analyst at Bernstein . She estimated Verizon Communications ' fixed-line phone business generated little or no cash , and therefore she argued it had become a necessity for the US group to obtain dividends from Verizon Wireless . Vodafone never wanted Verizon Wireless ' dividends to stop in 2005 , but , as the minority shareholder , it had no say over the matter . Verizon Communications decided six years ago that the cash generated by Verizon Wireless should be used to pay down its debt . However , many analysts saw the halt to the mobile operator 's dividend payments as an attempt to squeeze Vodafone out of Verizon Wireless . Verizon Wireless has always been an uneasy marriage of convenience between Verizon Communications and Vodafone . Their joint venture was formed in 2000 when their predecessor companies pooled their US mobile assets to create an operator with national scale , but it has been dogged by tensions . In 2006 , Vodafone rejected a bid by Verizon Communications to buy the UK group 's Verizon Wireless stake . Then in 2007 , Vodafone briefly considered the case for buying Verizon Communications . This disclosure brought a sharp riposte from Ivan Seidenberg , Verizon Communications ' chairman and chief executive , who told the Financial Times in 2008 : "" In the long term , my view is that we 're the hunter . That 's the way I see it , and I 'm trying to develop a new generation of hunters . "" This new generation will take centre stage next month when Lowell McAdam will replace Mr Seidenberg as Verizon Communications ' chief executive . Mr McAdam , currently chief operating officer , and Mr Colao have a better working relationship than Mr Seidenberg and Arun Sarin , the UK group 's former top manager . "" I think that Vittorio 's and my goal over the past 18 months has really been to try and turn the temperature down a little bit and to improve the bottom line of the relationship , "" said Mr McAdam last week . Mr McAdam and Mr Colao are members of the Verizon Wireless board , which at a meeting on Thursday agreed the $10bn dividend payment . Analysts highlighted how the Verizon Wireless board had only approved a one-off dividend for 2012 , but Vodafone hopes the US mobile operator 's cash distributions will become a recurring , annual event , because of Verizon Communications ' need to maintain its own pay-out to shareholders . The $10bn will be divided between the mobile operator 's parents based on the size of their shareholdings . Verizon Communications will therefore get $5.5bn. Vodafone is returning 70 per cent of its $4.5bn to shareholders via its special dividend , and the remainder will be used to reduce the UK group 's net debt . If Verizon Wireless ' dividends do continue beyond 2012 , Vodafone could use some of the cash for acquisitions . It is interested in buying rivals in some of its existing markets , including those in Europe and India . Since last September , Mr Colao has sold Vodafone 's minority stakes in Chinese , Japanese , French and Polish mobile operators , because he wants to focus on the UK group 's controlled assets . But a sale of Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless stake was always going to be more difficult , partly because the US mobile operator 's parents have been unable to agree on their joint venture 's valuation . Vodafone this week said the value of its Verizon Wireless stake had increased from $20bn in 2001 to $65bn-$70bn in 2011 , and any sale could incur a large capital gains tax bill . Verizon Communications and Vodafone now seem keen to reset their relationship . After years of sparring , the two groups are getting closer , notably by collaborating on serving their large business customers . Mr McAdam and Mr Colao have both recently played down the idea of a merger between Verizon Communications and Vodafone . But one investor who knows the two groups said a merger was possible in the medium to long term . "" I would be very surprised if we are still in the current situation in 10 years ' time , "" said the investor .

1-04-2008,699,"Threat of EU action knocks Vodafone Vodafone 's shares fell almost 4 per cent yesterday after claims that regulators were preparing to take action that would cut the UK mobile group 's European core earnings by 11 per cent . Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded their recommendation on Vodafone 's shares from "" buy "" to "" sell "" after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at Vodafone 's European mobile businesses by Pounds 900m between 2009 and 2012 . Meanwhile , Vodafone also had a further setback in its efforts to secure control of Vodacom , South Africa 's leading mobile operator . Telkom , South Africa 's fixed-line phone company , signalled it would not consider selling its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to Vodafone "" without a compelling strategic rationale "" . Vodafone owns the remainder of Vodacom . Nick Delfas , analyst at Morgan Stanley , published a research note predicting that Viviane Reding , European commissioner for telecoms , could take action that would cut Vodafone 's earnings . Its shares closed down 6.1p at 150.9p. Mr Delfas highlighted Ms Reding 's interest in the case for reducing termination rates - charges that mobile and fixed-line phone operators impose on each other when connecting calls to their networks . Mobile operators secure much revenue from fixed-line companies from termination rates because regulators currently allow the European wireless phone groups to , on average , charge almost nine times more than their wired rivals for connecting calls . Mr Delfas said Ms Reding , and national telecoms regulators , could insist on mobile termination rates coming down from an average of 9.67 cents a minute in 2007 to 2.5 cents by 2012 . He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would cut Vodafone 's European earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation by 11 per cent , or Pounds 900m . That would equate to an 8 per cent cut in the group 's ebitda . He also predicted cuts in termination rates could start a price war . Mr Delfas said the combined impact of rate cuts and a price war could reduce a typical large mobile operator 's European cash flow by 39 per cent between 2009-12 . He accused analysts and investors of ignoring Ms Reding 's interest in termination rates , adding some had made the same mistake prior to her law that last year forced cuts in the cost of making mobile phone calls while abroad . Ms Reding claims termination rates are de facto subsidies for the European mobile industry and wants the charges to reflect the true costs of connecting calls to networks . Terence Sinclair , analyst at Citi , used a research note to dispute Morgan Stanley 's analysis , saying the concerns were "" misplaced "" . He estimated that a 20 per cent fall in mobile termination rates would reduce Vodafone 's group earnings per share by less than 2 per cent . Meanwhile , Telkom said it had rejected an offer by Oger Telecom that would have made the Middle East group its largest shareholder . The offer was dependent on Telkom selling its stake in Vodacom to Vodafone . In November Telkom ended talks with MTN about selling its fixed-line phone business to the African mobile operator . That deal was linked to Telkom selling its Vodacom stake to Vodafone . Vodafone declined to comment . Ms Reding 's representative did not return calls .",threat of eu action knocks vodafone

But not in a good way . On the contrary , the continued strength of P&G underlines the competitive challenge faced by Unilever as the new management continues its task of bringing sustainable growth to the food and consumer goods group . Unilever 's figures will be helped by the weak comparative from Europe last year , when poor weather hit sales . And the performance from emerging markets is expected to be robust . Even so , although the range of analysts ' forecasts is wide , some are expecting no more than 1.5 per cent underlying sales growth , which would represent a slowdown in momentum compared with the first quarter . While analysts are divided about the forecasts , they are united in seeking greater clarity from the group about its investment in advertising and promotions . This is an important area where Unilever could help itself . The group 's retreat from the frequent updates and external targets of the Path to Growth years is understandable and sensible . The desire not to cut earnings targets , even as missed sales targets made them increasingly ambitious , appears to have been a factor in the failure to invest enough in the group 's most powerful brands . But Unilever does not have to box itself in to targets that might restrict its flexibility and give useful information to rivals to provide more data about what it has spent on advertising and promotions to date . In a recovery story as long as Unilever 's looks set to be , such information would give valuable comfort to investors along the way .",unilever's advertising lombard - martin dickson
2-02-2005,713,"Unilever 's challenge EUROPEAN COMMENT Procter & Gamble 's takeover of Gillette increases pressure on Unilever , under fire for slow growth and missed forecasts . The combined US group will overtake the Anglo-Dutch company in sales and be well placed to cut costs , develop new products and improve already superior margins . Unilever is widely expected to appease investors at its annual results presentation on February 10 by simplifying its structure of dual co-chairmen - possibly making Antony Burgmans , the Dutch head , executive chairman , and Frenchman Patrick Cescau , his counterpart at the UK arm , chief executive . It might not go as far as Royal Dutch / Shell in merging legal entities and share structures . As with Shell , changes will be welcome if they make decision-making swifter and more accountable , but on their own will not restore confidence . Unilever investors fear sales and earnings growth targets could again be downgraded . They want evidence of a strategy to expand its brands and innovate . The P&G-Gillette deal prompted speculation about mergers among companies such as Colgate-Palmolive of the US and UK-based Reckitt and Benckiser . Unilever is poorly placed to take part since its underperforming shares make it hard to strike good deals , not to mention the distraction of more upheaval . But it could see the landscape around it become more competitive . Unless it delivers on strategy it could come under pressure for radical steps it has so far resisted - such as splitting slow- growing food from its household products business , which would be a viable merger partner .",unilever's challenge european comment
27-04-2013,715,"Unilever 's shake-up Like P&G , Unilever spent a long time in a funk . For the best part of a decade , turnover barely budged , share performance was lacklustre and strategic direction was wanting , writes Louise Lucas . Under Paul Polman , himself a P&G alumnus who took up the reins at the Anglo-Dutch group at the start of 2009 , much has changed . Targeting a doubling of turnover to EUR80bn - over an unspecified timeframe but generally taken to be 2020 - he set about divesting small non-core assets , launching bold acquisitions , speeding up innovation and forging further into emerging markets , which now account for 57 per cent of revenues . So Skippy peanut butter and Chicken Tonight cook-in sauces were ejected from the larder . In their stead came the faster-growing and more profitable shampoos of Albert Culver and Russian cosmetics maker Kalina . Unilever is "" streets ahead of P&G "" on innovation , according to Warren Ackerman , analyst at Societe Generale . The maker of Dove shampoo and Flora margarine last year rolled out 90 innovations to more than 10 countries , a tenfold increase on 2009 levels . Mr Polman believes that new products are vital to tempt cash-strapped consumers to part with their dwindling disposable incomes . But it is not just Unilever that is giving P&G a run for its money . L'Oreal of France has been selling more skincare creams and cosmetics across the globe , helping it report a 5.5 per cent year-on-year increase in sales in the first quarter . Gallingly for P&G , competitors are grabbing share in some of its top markets . On home turf in the US , L'Oreal is elbowing P&G shampoos and conditioners off bathroom shelves . In China , one of the few emerging markets where P&G boasts a longer history than Unilever , L'Oreal lifted sales by 11 per cent year-on-year in its first quarter . Emerging markets are generally one of P&G 's weaker suits : approaching 40 per cent , its sales from these regions lag Colgate-Palmolive 's 50 per cent and virtually all European rivals . This is not all bad . Most participants flagged up softening in these markets in aggregate , and profitability tends to be lower , partly due to inflated media costs and higher capital expenditure . But P&G , the company that proudly launched 10 cent nappies in China - at a time when toddlers were most likely to be found wearing pants with strategic rips - can not afford to slip here . As makers of infant formula have discovered , even when sales of Scotch whisky or designer handbags start to flag , Chinese babies are a lucrative market .

5-05-2006,717,"Unilever 's ticking clock DAN ROBERTS LOMBARD Patrick Cescau rightly points out that his job as Unilever chief executive should be to sustain growth in the top line and improve margins . Sadly , yesterday 's 2 per cent increase in turnover and 0.2 per cent decline in operating margin was not satisfactory . One quarter is too soon to declare this recovery stalled , but the continued slide in European sales ( still more than a third of Unilever 's business ) is an alarming sign of how much more he has to do . Getting a company this big to start innovating like its nimbler competitors may simply prove too much even for the admired Mr Cescau . The alternatives are equally unpalatable but deserve constant reappraisal . One much-rumoured option is a leveraged buy-out that would finally smash the record set by KKR 's Dollars 31bn record bid for RJR Nabisco . Adjusted for today 's prices , Unilever would be a similar size and would provide rich pickings . Better still would be to take some of their methods and apply them in-house . Given the success of more focused competitors such as Danone and Reckitt , the perennial question of whether Unilever needs to be split into separate food and household and personal care ( HPC ) companies deserves serious consideration . Given its controversial decision to maintain dual listings in London and Amsterdam it could simply reverse 76 years of history and create a UK HPC business called Lever Brothers and a Dutch food group called Unie .",unilever's ticking clock dan roberts lombard
1-05-2013,719,"Unilever Why would you do something like this ? On Monday , investors could have bought shares in India 's Hindustan Unilever for Rs500 . Yesterday Unilever , which already owns just over half of HUL , offered Rs600 to buy up to another 23 per cent of it . That values HUL at 36 times forecast earnings . Unilever 's shareholders should be asking what they will be getting for such a huge valuation that they could not have bought more cheaply a day earlier . Unilever says the deal is earnings-enhancing . Irrelevant . And according to Morgan Stanley , the debt to finance the purchase costs EUR91m to service . In exchange , the company will keep EUR110m of HUL earnings that would otherwise have gone to minorities . So a EUR19m gain versus Unilever 's forecast earnings of EUR5bn . Are there other reasons for such largesse ? Cost savings are not one of them . Unilever already controls HUL , so it is tough to see where any new savings would come from . Any big change on that front requires full ownership . Unilever says that HUL is a valued local brand and that it does not want to buy out the rest . And the higher valuation accorded to HUL 's shares ( 30 times earnings before Tuesday 's offer , against 19 for Unilever itself ) is a handy benchmark for Unilever 's emerging markets business . That said , increasing the stake from 52 per cent to 75 per cent does make a full buyout easier if it ever decides to go down that route . But there might be a Machiavellian purpose . HUL minorities were aghast this year when Unilever increased the royalty charge that it levies over its Indian subsidiary from 1.4 per cent of sales to more than 3 per cent . New Indian regulations could beef up minority rights . Good reason , perhaps , for Unilever to increase its influence now . Whatever the reason , HUL shareholders should jump at the generous price . But Unilever 's owners deserve a better explanation .",unilever
10-02-2006,721,"Unilever Unilever 's latest announcement conjures up the image of a get- fit fanatic , who gulps Slim-Fast but can not resist the odd dollop of ice-cream . As part of the rationalisation of the consumer conglomerate 's unwieldy portfolio , the bulk of its underperforming European frozen foods business will be sold . Other good news included a 5 per cent year-on-year increase in fourth-quarter like- for-like group sales . Unfortunately , last year also witnessed a big rise in advertising and promotional spending . Hence , full-year and fourth-quarter underlying margins fell by 80 and 130 basis points , respectively . Four-fifths of the extra money went on advertising , rather than shorter-lived promotions . That offers some comfort that the money is being spent wisely . Time will tell . The management 's overall strategy is sound , but licking Unilever into shape will take time . Yet the share price has risen 19 per cent since the start of 2005 , even as consensus forecasts for 2006 earnings have fallen by 7 per cent . Such optimism is a consistent feature of European food stocks ( 55 per cent of Unilever 's group sales fall into this camp ) . This year , sector earnings are expected to grow by 9 per cent , despite having averaged just 3 per cent since 2000 . Including buybacks , Unilever yields about 5 per cent on 2006 forecasts .

30-04-2010,723,"Unilever Unilever has seen a few false dawns , but this time the faint glow in the east may just broaden into a sunlit morning . Like all the best chief executives , Paul Polman - in place for five quarters now - is benefiting in part from his predecessor 's actions . Patrick Cescau turned Unilever into something looking less like the civil service and more like a lean , responsive consumer goods company . Mr Polman is taking advantage of that to push for aggressive innovation and volume-led growth . The Anglo-Dutch company 's impressive 7.6 per cent first-quarter volume growth beat both US arch-rivals that also reported on Thursday - Procter & Gamble ( 7 per cent ) and Colgate-Palmolive ( 6 per cent ) . True , it was achieved against feeble prior-year comparisons , and with prices down 3.3 per cent , year on year - though the price cuts had already been made in 2009 . Strikingly , however , Unilever increased its operating margin by 60 basis points ( P&G 's was up by 80bps ) , while delivering a hefty increase in advertising and promotional spending - worth 220bp of sales . It is achieving the rare feat of increasing volumes , expanding margins and beefing up support for its brands , simultaneously . Unilever is being helped by lower commodity prices , which will reverse in the second half . Toughening comparisons will also make it difficult to sustain such robust reported volume gains . But the latest quarterly figures will reinforce investor confidence that the underlying momentum can be maintained . Meanwhile , the sheen dimmed a little this week on domestic rival Reckitt Benckiser , whose first-quarter figures failed , uncharacteristically , to meet expectations . Despite a subsequent sell-off , Reckitt 's shares still trade at a small premium to Unilever's . As the sky brightens over Unilever , that gap should continue to narrow .",unilever
4-08-2006,725,"Unilever The years go by and the question remains . Can Unilever turn itself round ? Improvements at the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group must be acknowledged . Pre-tax profits rose 16 per cent in the first half of 2006 , on 6 per cent sales growth . Patrick Cescau , chief executive , congratulated himself yesterday on six consecutive quarters of growth . Unilever has a slimmed-down management team and a slimmed- down portfolio of businesses now it has sold some underperformers . It also communicates better with investors . But the question remains . Underlying first-half sales growth of 3.4 per cent is hardly stellar . Peers such as Procter & Gamble , which on Wednesday said underlying second-quarter sales rose 8 per cent , managed underlying sales growth of more than 6 per cent last year . In Europe , Unilever 's first-half underlying sales barely grew . There is little evidence of the group being able to raise sales volumes without price cuts . Spending on advertising and promotions is rising as a percentage of turnover - necessary to propel sales growth but one reason behind a deterioration in margins . Underlying operating margins , 14 per cent in the second quarter , were 1 percentage point lower than a year ago . Although some might beg to differ , Mr Cescau believes Unilever has restored competitiveness . He has set a target of 3-5 per cent sustainable underlying sales growth , and an operating margin greater than 15 per cent by 2010 . Such undemanding goals underline the main risk for investors - that the management does well enough to resist radical change , like a break-up , but not well enough to outperform . Add to that another danger - that Unilever 's cash pile gets squandered on underperforming acquisitions . Both risks suggest there is little chance that Unilever 's shares ' discount to its peers , a legacy of its inferior operating performance over a long period , will disappear .",unilever

The results surprised analysts , who had questioned whether the company - which has struggled to match the performance of competitors such as Procter & Gamble in recent years - could match its strong first-quarter earnings . Michael Steib , equity analyst at Morgan Stanley , said : "" Unilever has taken a significant step today towards proving that their top line can grow again . "" Unilever 's shares rose 3.8 per cent to close at 572p yesterday , their highest level since April 2004 . The company 's stock has gained 11.8 per cent this year . Analysts said Unilever produced its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2002 in spite of a second write- down in its meal replacement business , Slim-Fast . Although Slim-Fast only accounts for about 1 per cent of Unilever 's overall sales , its poor performance is seen by analysts as an indictment of management . Unilever took a Euros 353m ( Pounds 244m ) write-down in Slim-Fast after sales of its products fell 25 per cent in the first half . Unilever recorded a Euros 650m write-down on the business six months ago . Patrick Cescau , Unilever 's chief executive , declined to comment on whether it would put Slim-Fast up for sale and said it would focus on turning the business round . But he said : "" I do n't exclude anything . "" The Slim-Fast write-down hurt Unilever 's operating profits , which fell 18 per cent in the quarter . The rise in overall sales volume was driven by strong demand for Unilever 's products , including Omo laundry detergent and Pond 's cream , in Asia and Africa . Mr Cescau said that while he was satisfied with its progress , the company still had to restore credibility with investors . "" There 's still a lot on the agenda , "" he said . Unilever recently restructured its management team , abandoning a dual chairman and chief executive structure , with Mr Cescau becoming the company 's sole chief executive . Yesterday Mr Cescau said his focus remained on growing the business , particularly in Europe , its key market .

The news drove HUL 's share price up 17.4 per cent to Rs584 ( $10.8 ) , just shy of Unilever 's Rs600 a share offer . The maker of Dove shampoo and Flora margarine currently holds 52.5 per cent of HUL and wants to top that up to 75 per cent , the maximum allowed under Indian regulations . If successful , the bid would see Unilever tighten its grip on a company whose century-old ownership structure dates to the British Raj and snatch a bigger slice of India 's superior growth rates . Unilever is offering a generous 36 times next year 's consensus forecast earnings , or a 26 per cent premium on HUL 's undisturbed share price . That is roughly in line with similar deals carried out by multinationals , most recently drugmaker GlaxoSmith-Kline which late last year lifted its 43.2 per cent stake in its pivotal Indian division , GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare , to 75 per cent . However , it may not be enough to win its prize . Aberdeen Asset Management , one of the biggest investors in HUL , with roughly 4 per cent , said the price was not as attractive as first appeared . "" The share price has been very weak since they announced royalty hikes a couple of months back , "" said Adrian Lim , Singapore-based senior investment manager at Aberdeen . On a long-term view , he added : "" Consumer staples are in an expansionary phase and so we are happy to sit out as shareholders for the next five , 10 years . "" The news came a day after HUL , India 's largest consumer goods company , announced a better-than- expected 15 per cent rise in first quarter net profit . Unilever does not report quarterly profits , but that is almost double last year 's net profit growth of 7 per cent . Paul Polman , Unilever 's chief executive , said the decision to increase the stake was part of a strategic focus on emerging markets . "" The long heritage and great brands of Hindustan Unilever , and the significant growth potential of a country of 1.3bn people , makes India a strategic long-term priority for the business . "" He indicated that he expected significant take-up of the open offer , which is expected to begin in June , and which he called "" a liquidity opportunity at what we believe to be an attractive premium for existing shareholders "" . Bankers , who see further opportunities for more stake-raising in Indian listed subsidiaries - by companies such as Colgate-Palmolive , Procter & Gamble , Nestle and Castrol - concurred . "" The stars are aligned , "" said one . Stars include deflated equity prices , a weaker rupee and growing markets . Another added that such deals were a less risky way of buying emerging market growth , which required no due diligence , and was "" right under their noses "" .

The acquisition , the first one made with the direct involvement of new chief executive Paul Polman , gives Unilever Sanex handwashes , shower gels and deodorants as well as the Dutch personal care brand Zwitsal and German brand Duschdas . Unilever said Sara Lee 's skin care brands would complement Unilever brands such as Lifebuoy soaps and Dove deodorants . Unilever also wants to increase its exposure to cheaper priced products to attract value-conscious consumers . Most of Sara Lee 's products are in the "" value "" or mid-tier price range , with Dove deodorants costing more than Sanex deodorants . Analysts at Credit Suisse said the acquisition showed Unilever was becoming more active in driving volume growth and less reliant on cost-cutting . People close to Unilever said the company was becoming more comfortable making large acquisitions as it completes a long period of internal restructuring . "" They really feel their house is in order so their ability to integrate these deals is great , "" said one person . The deal raises Unilever 's exposure to developing markets . The UK is the biggest part of Sara Lee 's business , followed by the Netherlands , with around 15 per cent of sales in emerging markets such as the Philippines and South Africa . Warren Ackerman , analyst at Evolution Securities , said the deal would increase Unilever 's European skin cleansing market share from 13 per cent to 23 per cent and increase its leadership position over Colgate , Henkel and Beiersdorf . Sara Lee decided to sell its personal care and household business , which contributes some 17 per cent of total revenues , about six months ago as part of a plan to transform the US group into a smaller , more focused company . Unilever bought only half of the Sara Lee business that was up for sale . "" We never bid for the whole , "" said one person close to the company . "" It was a deal made to Unilever 's terms . "" The Sara Lee business is worth EUR750m in sales , and has earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of EUR128m , making the value of the deal a reasonable 10 times ebitda . Brands remaining with Sara Lee include Kiwi shoe polish , Ambi Pur air fresheners and Ridsect insecticides . Unilever was advised by JPMorgan . Sara Lee is being advised by Goldman Sachs .

3-11-2006,747,"Unilever investors welcome surprise FOOD PRODUCERS Increased marketing investment in ice-cream , shampoos and deodorants led to higher third-quarter sales at Unilever , whose underlying revenue growth of 4.8 per cent surpassed expectations . Analysts were happy to see an improvement on last quarter 's sales growth of 3.9 per cent . John McMillin , of Prudential Securities , said : "" Clearly this is a step in the right direction . "" Unilever surprised investors by announcing a one-off Euros 750m ( Pounds 502m ) dividend , which replaces a planned Euros 500m share buy-back , to be paid in December . Shares in Unilever rose 60p to Pounds 13.54. It has been spending more on marketing , as well as research and development , as it tries to improve sales growth , which has lagged competitors like Procter & Gamble . Spending on advertising and promotions as a percentage of sales rose 80 basis points in the quarter . However , Unilever is still battling to lift profit margins . This quarter it reported margins of 14.8 per cent , 80 basis points lower than the same period a year earlier . Tim Potter , of Goldman Sachs , said the company was likely to turn the corner on revenue growth this year and "" 2007 could be the year when it turns the corner on margins "" . Pre-tax profits fell 19 per cent to Euros 1.1bn due to comparisons with one-off gains in the third quarter of 2005 . The company had also set aside Euros 300m for a possible settlement related to the conversion of preference shares issued by its Dutch arm in 1999 . Turnover rose 4 per cent at constant exchange rates to Euros 10bn , while earnings per share from continuing operations fell 47 per cent to Euros 0.25. Unilever said it had succeeded in putting through price increases on its laundry , tea and olive oil products to help offset higher commodity costs , which had added Euros 500m to total costs this year . It remained "" cautious "" about commodities in the fourth quarter . The group plans to undertake a Euros 1.5bn share buy-back programme in 2007 . Nine-month pre-tax profits were Euros 3.79bn ( Euros 3.65bn ) on turnover which advanced to Euros 29.9bn ( Euros 28.6bn ) .

26-06-2007,749,"Unilever likely to shed more assets Unilever is expected to make further disposals of underperforming assets following the sale of its Brazilian margarine brands and some factory machinery to Perdigao , the South American food company , for about Pounds 20m . The performance of the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group has been gradually improving under the stewardship of chief executive Patrick Cescau , with the company recently reporting a 5.7 per cent rise in under-lying first-quarter sales against a targeted 3-5 per cent , and a 0.4 percentage point rise in profit margins . However , Unilever remains under pressure from investors to improve its market share and to increase profit margins from last year 's 13.6 per cent . Analysts believe the group is likely to pursue more asset sales , with some suggesting it may dispose of its laundry detergent brands in the US and Europe , including Omo , Persil , Whisk and All . UBS has estimated a sale of Unilever 's "" developed world detergents "" - to either a private equity or a trade buyer such as Henkel - could be worth some Euros 3bn ( Pounds 2bn ) . Although Unilever has a strong laundry detergents business in emerging markets , rival Procter & Gamble dominates the market in the US . P&G is also the leader in Europe , followed by Henkel and Unilever . Analysts believe P&G has been taking market share from Unilever in the US and western Europe . Unilever owns three local margarine brands in Brazil - Doriana , Delicata and Claybom - as well as its global Becel brand . With sales of the local brands in decline , and Unilever holding the number three position in the margarine market , the company decided the best option for the local brands was to sell them . Perdigao sells chilled and frozen foods such as pizzas , pastas and meats and exports to more than 100 countries . Unilever will keep the Becel brand , through which it sells low- cholesterol margarines , and has formed a joint venture with Perdigao to manage it . Unilever will also license the brand to Perdigao for use on foods other than margarine . Unilever said the joint venture would also help it identify "" new business opportunities .

8-03-2006,751,"Unilever lines up Pounds 200m of ITV airtime Unilever is today expected to announce a four-year agreement to buy Pounds 200m worth of airtime with ITV , bucking the trend of declining advertising revenues at the broadcaster . The agreement , which could be announced alongside ITV 's preliminary results , replaces an agreement struck four years ago for a similar sum but will see a greater share of Unilever 's budget spent on ITV 's new channels . Shareholders in ITV have been concerned about an expected 14 per cent fall in advertising on ITV1 , its core mass-market channel , in the first quarter of the yearand are expecting guidance about whether ITV sees this as a seasonal anomaly or a pattern for the full year . In 2004 , a weak first quarter was followed by a recovery in the second quarter . Unilever , which owns brands such as Dove , Lynx , Flora and Hellmann 's , brokered the deal through Mindshare , the WPP-owned media buying agency . It is expected to spread its spending across ITV1 and the newer channels , with family-focused brands such as Persil remaining predominantly on ITV1 and younger brands such as Lynx getting more exposure on other channels . Unilever said yesterday : "" Obviously ITV is still the prime deliverer of mass audiences even in this fragmenting market and it 's still important for us and helps with our big brands . "" Other brands lent themselves to channels such as ITV2 , ITV3 and ITV4 , which have more targeted audiences , the company said . ITV would not comment . The broadcaster is expected to deliver a strong increase in pre-tax profit for 2005 , up from Pounds 255m to Pounds 435m as favourable regulatory judgements are expected to outweigh the impact of declining advertising revenues . Turnover is forecast to increase from Pounds 2.08bn to Pounds 2.16bn and earnings per share should rise from 5.32p to about 7.5p. Analysts are also looking for an update on ITV 's new media strategy . ITV Consumer , the division that manages its digital initiatives , acquired Friends Reunited late last year and is expected to give some details of how the business has been integrated , including the potential for cross-promotion between television and online .",unilever lines up pounds 200m of itv airtime
28-09-2010,753,"Unilever looks to clean up in Alberto Culver buy personal goods ; News analysis ; The deal places the group firmly in a fast-growing sector , writes John O'Doherty Unilever 's swoop on Alberto Culver was predominantly greeted with enthusiasm by analysts and investors , with most seeing it as a shrewd move into the fastest-growing sector of the consumer goods industry . There was consensus about the price tag , with most analysts regarding the deal as fully priced but not excessively so . Assuming earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation for 2010 of $259m ( pound(s)163m ) and the small amount of cash held by Alberto Culver , the $3.7bn price tag will mean an enterprise value to ebitda multiple of 14 times . Clive Black , an analyst at Shore Capital , says : "" The valuations for consumer staples , and particularly branded consumer staples , have remained resilient over the past two or three years . You could n't say there has been a collapse or a contraction of multiples . "" Andrew Wood of Sanford Bernstein says the multiple was well below the average of 17 times ebitda paid for other M&A deals in the health and personal care sector over the past decade . It compares favourably with the most recent acquisition in personal care products , that of Reckitt Benckiser taking over SSL International , the maker of Durex condoms and Scholl footcare , in July this year for pound(s)1.5bn. That deal , albeit for a different business , had a multiple of 18 . Operationally , the deal is attractive to Unilever for giving the group extra fire-power in the health and personal care category . Personal care is a higher-margin business than Unilever 's other product categories . The group 's operating margins in the personal care category , which includes haircare , were 15.5 per cent last year , above the group margin of 12.6 per cent . Personal care is also faster-growing . In the most recent quarter , Unilever 's sales of health personal care goods rose 7.8 per cent to EUR3.6bn ( pound(s)3bn ) , compared with growth of only 3.5 per cent for ice-cream and beverages , and 0.5 per cent for savoury foods , dressings and spreads . A similar dynamic is at work at Unilever 's rival Reckitt Benckiser , the maker of Cillit Bang cleaner and Finish dishwasher powder , where health and personal care is growing at 14 per cent a year , compared with 8 per cent growth across the whole business . The deal will also give Unilever more scale in haircare , where it has previously been underweight . Unilever has market share in the haircare category of about 7 per cent in both the US and the UK , and the Alberto Culver acquisition will double its market share in both countries . This will give it greater strength in negotiating with retailers and allow it to compete more effectively with rivals such as L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble , which occupy the top two positions in US haircare . The Alberto Culver portfolio also has an added benefit in helping Unilever to occupy a broader range of price points . The V05 brand will round out Unilever 's product offering in the lower end of the market , while TRESemme and Nexxus will compete at the premium end . Where this leaves Unilever 's plans for emerging markets growth is less clear . Paul Polman , chief executive , has set a long-term target of changing the revenue mix in the group 's business from its 50-50 developed markets / developing markets split to a 30-70 split , meaning it will need a large increase in sales to the developing world in the coming years . But while Alberto Culver has some sales in Argentina and Mexico , it is predominantly based in North America , where it makes 65 per cent of its sales , with the UK accounting for another 15 per cent . In total , developing markets account for only 10 per cent of Alberto Culver 's turnover . The personal care business of Sara Lee , acquired last year , was equally weighted toward developed markets , with most of its sales in western Europe , comprising brands such as Radox and Brylcreem . However , it is still possible for Unilever to use its existing global distribution network to promote these newly acquired brands in the developing world . This would mean the group could avoid significant acquisitions in the developing world and rely instead on a continuation of the existing trends of faster growth in emerging markets to achieve the desired revenue mix . In the most recent quarter , underlying sales at Unilever in western Europe fell 2 per cent to EUR1.3bn. However , in Asia , Africa and central and eastern Europe , sales rose 8 per cent , to pound(s)4.7bn. "" This is not an emerging market play but a scale issue to compete on more equal terms with P&G in the mature US and UK markets , "" says one analyst .

Unilever 's first-quarter sales levels were poor , dropping 1.8 per cent , compared to a 1.6 per cent decline in the previous quarter . Mr Polman said it was too early for Unilever to produce rising sales volumes . "" Life does n't change in three months and the economy has not gotten better . "" But he claimed Unilever was making "" good progress "" with plans to revive volume growth , which include bringing new products to market faster and developing cheaper ones . Analysts said they were becoming more optimistic that Mr Polman would deliver on his promises , even though he has refrained from giving specific financial guidance . Julian Hardwick , analyst at RBS , said : "" The body language is more positive than it was in February . . . they 've now committed to delivering an improved volume performance . "" Underlying sales growth of 4.8 per cent was stronger than expected as Unilever benefited from price increases pushed through last year . Martin Deboo , analyst at Investec , said Unilever should be able to start reducing prices later this year - which could lead to higher sales volumes - as commodity costs decline . Investec estimates that Unilever 's products are 12 per cent more expensive today than they were two years ago . Western Europe remains a difficult market for Unilever , with sales volumes dropping 3.7 per cent in the quarter as consumers switched to cheaper own-label products , particularly in margarine . "" Consumers are re-questioning the value equation , "" Mr Polman said , adding that Unilever 's Surf laundry detergent was the company 's fastest growing brand in the UK because it was priced at the lower end of the -market . Unilever has been trying to make its products more appealing to consumers . It has introduced a cheaper version of Surf in South Africa , and has revamped its Domestos bleach range in the UK to include a bleach that claims to be effective for 24 hours ( up from 12 hours previously ) . In the US , it has licensed the Starbucks brand for ice cream . It is cutting costs by reducing the number of formulas it uses in its household and food products and is extending campaigns promoting the "" goodness "" of margarine to more countries to try and boost sales .

3-08-2007,759,"Unilever restructures LEX Plus ca change , plus c'est la meme chose . Unilever shares bounced 4 per cent yesterday on the announcement of another push to cut costs and reshuffle its portfolio of businesses . Planned spending on restructuring between 2007-09 is to more than double to Euros 3bn , with the aim of exceeding a 15 per cent operating margin by 2010 . The money will go towards further streamlining of management , axing a tenth of the workforce , and improving distribution . There is a rather strong sense , however , that Unilever has been here before . The "" path to growth "" programme launched in 1999 , aimed to pep up revenues and deliver a 15 per cent operating margin , by spending Euros 5bn on restructuring over four years . Margins briefly hit the target in 2004 but have since fallen back to 13.7 per cent . Restructuring has become a cost of doing business in a mature , competitive industry , with the resultant savings tough to retain . Similarly , the group says it hopes to dispose of businesses generating more than Euros 2bn of annual sales , including the North American laundry operations . It is tempting to see the hand of new chairman Michael Treschow here , brought on board as an outsider with a reputation for successful surgery at Electrolux . Yet this is hardly a radical departure from the recent past - disposals since 2000 have carved out Euros 8bn worth of revenues . Meanwhile , growth remains a problem . Developing markets , contributing two-fifths of sales and expanding at 10 per cent a year , are responsible for virtually all Unilever 's sales growth . In spite of an improving western European economy , sales there remain sluggish . So while Unilever expects to hit the top end of its 3-5 per cent sales growth target this year , it still lags behind peers . Reckitt Benckiser grew at twice that rate in the first half , and Nestle is running at about a 7.5 per cent pace . The new , new leaf at Unilever has yet to be turned .",unilever restructures lex

Unilever is due to ann-ounce full-year results on February 7 and analysts believe the company may commit to a large dividend increase , a bigger share buy-back or both . Rob Mann at Collins Stewart said he believed Unilever had an under-leveraged balance sheet and therefore could return cash to shareholders and still make bolt- on acquisitions . Citigroup noted that Unilever offered investors good exposure to emerging markets ( which now represent 44 per cent sales and a similar proportion of profits ) and could take on an extra Euros 7bn ( Pounds 5.3bn ) of debt .

Manufacturers of food and other staples , a sector trading on historically high valuations , have fallen firmly into two camps this reporting season : those that trump expectations , such as France 's Danone , and those that miss . Nestle and Diageo , respectively the world 's biggest food group and distiller , have reported earnings in recent days that fell short of investors ' expectations . Procter & Gamble 's shares fell heavily on Wednesday after the owner of brands such as Pantene and Crest reported disappointing sales figures . Unilever , maker of Flora margarine and Dove shampoo , had to contend with strong comparables from the year-ago period and poor spring weather across Europe , which crimped ice cream sales . The company reported a rise in annual underlying sales growth in the first quarter of 4.9 per cent , 70 basis points below consensus market expectations . On a reported basis , and taking into account a negative hit from foreign exchange rates , Unilever lifted turnover 0.2 per cent to EUR12.2bn. Europe overall proved the weak spot ; underlying sales reversed 3.1 per cent as people both bought fewer Unilever goods and paid less for them . "" Southern Europe remains particularly difficult and consumer confidence in northern Europe continues to be eroded by fiscal tightening and the continuing impact of the financial crisis , "" Unilever said . Emerging markets grew a robust 10.4 per cent , in contrast to the softening of growth flagged by some of its peers . Nowhere was that more clearly highlighted than at French distiller Pernod-Ricard , whose brands include Chivas Regal and Absolut vodka . Like its peers , Pernod Ricard has ridden the wave of Chinese demand for Scotch and Cognac , reporting organic growth in the country of 18 per cent in the first half . However , the latest numbers for the third quarter showed a 2 per cent contraction , according to Deutsche Bank . Overall the French group reported organic sales growth of 6.1 per cent versus consensus of 7.4 per cent .

Unilever was criticised by shareholders at its annual meeting in London last month for the lack of diversity on its board . The 14-member board contains only one woman , non-executive director Baroness Chalker , and no representatives from countries inthe southern hemisphere . Mr Cescau told the Financial Times that Unilever 's board did not reflect the diversity of the company . Some 30 per cent of Unilever 's managers are women and his seven- member executive team contains two Indians , he said . "" That 's a very diverse team . "" Unilever is also searching for a new non-executive chairman with its current chairman Antony Burgmans due to retire by the company 's annual meeting next year . Mr Cescau declined to comment on the search process but confirmed that the new chairman would be an outsider . The prospect of changes to the board - although MrCescau did not specify a date - comes as Unilever 's first sole chief executive tries to improve the company 's image with investors and analysts . "" Leadership is about dealing with change , "" he said , adding that the most important changes to be made at Unilever were in the behaviour of employees rather than processes and systems . Mr Cescau spent the end of last week in Paris trying to "" articulate "" Unilever 's transformation at an international gathering of business leaders from the food industry . "" We 've started with some negative baggage , "" he said , referring to Unilever 's past difficulties in producing growth in line with the market 's expectations . He said the Europeanbusiness , which accountsfor some 40 per cent of turnover , was making progress because its rate of decline in underlying sales has slowed from 3 per cent in 2004 to 0.5 per cent in the first quarter . "" This is progress . "" However , he admitted that there was still a gap between Unilever and its competition , such as Nestle , Danone and L'Oreal , with their faster rates of growth . "" We need to continue to work hard in Europe to bring Europe to a level we are satisfied with , "" he said . Unilever 's total underlying sales have been growing at around 3 per cent . Mr Cescau said that , if sales were to improve further , the company needed to invest more in operations that were growing quickly , such as emerging markets and personal care . Mr Cescau said Unilever will invest "" disproportionately "" in both these areas . Personal care , which accounts for a quarter of Unilever 's turnover , grew at 6 per cent last year . He maintained , however , that all businesses - including food - had a contribution to make to the long-term growth of the company and that he would be satisfied with slow growth of some categories if they can deliver healthy cash flow .",unilever to broaden mix of board food producers

The deal would be the biggest acquisition since Paul Polman became chief executive of Unilever in January 2009 . It would be the second big takeover under his tenure , following on from the $1.9bn deal to acquire the European personal care division of Sara Lee in September last year . While it produces products such as low-sodium food dressings and baking sprays , Alberto Culver would primarily expand Unilever 's operations in personal care products such as skincare , hair care and body wash . As a result of the deal , Unilever would be the largest company in hair conditioning , the second-largest producer of shampoo and the third largest in sales of hair styling products . It would double the company 's market share in hair care both in the UK and the US . But the group would still trail L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble in the US hair care market . "" Personal care is a strategic category for Unilever and growing rapidly , "" Mr Polman said . "" Ten years ago it represented 20 per cent of our turnover . Strong organic growth has driven it to now reach over 30 per cent , with strong positions in many of the emerging markets . "" Alberto Culver was formed in 1955 by the Chicago entrepreneur Leonard Lavin , who took a Los Angeles-based supplier of beauty products and used it to develop the VO5 hairdressing brand . Alberto Culver still owns the Alberto VO5 brand of hair care products , but has expanded into skincare with the Simple , St Ives and Noxzema brands . It owns an array of food brands including Baker 's Joy and Mrs Dash food seasonings . Analysts said Unilever appeared to be paying a demanding price for Alberto Culver but the deal made strategic sense . The proposed price tag values the company , including its small cash pile , at about 14 times the consensus forecast for its 2010 earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of $259m . The group is targeting synergies of a minimum 10 per cent of sales , or $160m , by cutting overlaps in distribution , sales , manufacturing and head office costs . For the 12 months ending in June , Alberto Culver made revenues of $1.6bn and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of more than $250m . Mr Polman described Alberto Culver as a "" bolt-on acquisition "" and signalled that Unilever was not about to shift strategy to target large deals .

7-08-2009,775,"Unilever vows to focus on cheaper brands Food Producers Consumer goods companies need to change their business models and develop brands that can be sold at cheaper prices , according to Unilever 's chief executive . "" The consumer is increasingly more value conscious . . . I do n't think that 's going to change , "" Paul Polman , Unilever 's chief executive said , adding that companies increasingly have to "" stretch "" brands up and down the price ladder . Mr Polman 's comments echo rival Procter & Gamble , which on Wednesday said it would step up efforts to make cheaper "" valuefocused "" products as its sales volumes dropped 4 per cent . To improve the "" value "" it offers consumers , Unilever has been improving the quality of the Surf laundry brand it sells in South Africa ; adding whitening agents to the White Now mouthwash it sells in France ; and reducing the size and prices of the Rexona deodorants it sells in Germany . Unilever 's shares yesterday rose 5.4 per cent to pound(s)16.34 as it reported a 2 per cent rise in second-quarter sales volumes following a 1.8 per cent decline in the first quarter . Underlying sales rose 4.1 per cent in the quarter . The volume increase reflects a stronger focus on innovation under Mr Polman 's leadership , who has replaced 35 of Unilever 's top 100 executives since taking on the CEO job at the start of the year . Mr Polman has introduced "" 30-day action plans "" to turn round brands with declining sales . "" We want to move the [ Unilever ] culture more from discussing and analysing . . . to action , "" he said . More than a dozen brands globally have action plans , including Seda shampoo in Brazil . Sales volumes in Europe rose 1 per cent following five quarters of declines as the company increased spending on advertising and promotions for the first time in a year . A 50 basis point increase in advertising and promotions as a percentage of sales contributed to a 60 basis point decline in underlying operating margins , but Mr Polman said margins should improve over the remainder of the year as commodity costs fell . Sales volumes rose 3.3 per cent in developing countries , more than double the rate of growth in either the Americas or Europe . "" There 's clearly a certain decoupling of countries going on , "" Mr Polman said . Total sales rose 1 per cent to EUR10.46bn ( $15bn ) . Second-quarter pre-tax profits fell 12 per cent to EUR1.2bn due to one-time disposal profits a year earlier , as well as pension financing and tax charges . Warren Ackerman , analyst at Evolution Securities , said : "" Polman is starting to make a difference . "" However , he cautioned that Unilever still needed to deliver on underlying earnings growth , which may become more difficult as commodity costs fall and retailers push for further price cuts , especially in markets like Europe . Underlying sales growth was strongest in Unilever 's home care business during the quarter , with sales up 9.2 per cent .

28-09-2010,777,"Unilever / Alberto Culver Unilever is putting its money where its mouth isn't . The global consumer goods company talks a lot about increasing its presence in emerging markets , which already account for half of sales . But on Monday it agreed to spend $3.7bn on Alberto Culver , which mostly sells its shampoo and creams in the US and the UK - sluggish markets at best . Unilever wants to beef up its market share in hair care . Its target has enjoyed strong growth there , thanks to the salon-in-the-supermarket brand TRESemme . Unilever 's personal care sector is also growing fast : sales rose 16 per cent in the first half of this year , about twice as fast as ice cream and home care . The price is more salon than supermarket , at almost 15 times earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation for the past fiscal year to June . Analysts reckon on at least $160m in annual cost synergies . Add those to Alberto Culver 's expected $260m operating profit next year , take off tax , and earnings should rise by about $290m . In other words , the acquisition will deliver an initial return of about 8 per cent , more or less in line with estimates for Unilever 's post-acquisition weighted average cost of capital . Of course , the return could improve over time . Unilever 's investors appear to be keen - the shares rose in a falling market . Yet the question remains : why did n't Unilever spend its money in emerging markets where populations , incomes and sales are rising so quickly ? Perhaps because it is hard to spend $4bn in the developing world well - few large and attractive acquisition targets are left . Blowing the cash on advertising would just spark a competitive response , not make people richer faster . This unimaginative acquisition shows that even with a strong balance sheet and a market capitalisation of about $85bn , the world is not your oyster .",unileveralberto culver

"" This improvement underpins our view that volume growth will surprise on the upside , "" said JPMorgan , which repeated an "" overweight "" rating . Cadbury looked to be faring worse , the broker said . It thought Cadbury 's UK sales had been sharply below company targets since July . The company has cranked up its promotions after last month 's bid from Kraft , so a sales miss looks unlikely , JPMorgan added . Cadbury closed flat at 785p , with the stock inching off lows after US value investor Franklin Resources said it had raised its stake to 7.6 per cent . Oil stocks helped underpin the FTSE 100 , which added 7.23 points at 5,161.87 after a quiet day 's trading . The index rose 3.5 per cent on the week , thanks largely to the falling US dollar . Whitbread added 1.6 per cent to pound(s)12.69 ahead of results on Tuesday , with Morgan Stanley , UBS and Deutsche Bank all advising clients to buy before the release . An upgrade this week from BarCap also helped . InterContinental Hotels , up 1.5 per cent to 823 1/2 p , mirrored a rally in US peer Marriott International overnight , which beat forecasts but provided a relatively downbeat view of 2010 . Credit Suisse said the positive industry trends were more significant than the murky outlook . BT Group was up 0.7 per cent to 135 3/4 p after announcing it would accelerate the roll-out of its fibre network at no extra cost . The group said it would connect directly to 2.5m homes by 2012 , against a 1m target previously . UBS said the move provided a significant sales boost , as fibre wholesale tariffs are unregulated and allow service bundling . Moreover , the threat of extra spending from fibre was an investor concern , it said . Competition worries in the US and India continued to dog Vodafone , down 1.6 per cent to 132 1/2 p. The stock has also been hit by renewed speculation about how it could resolve an uneasy relationship with US joint venture partner Verizon Communications . BAE Systems slipped 1.5 per cent to 319 1/4 p on concerns that a trading update next week could unnerve investors . BAE 's appointment this week of Paul Anderson , former BHP Billiton executive , also spurred talk of a major acquisition . Autonomy was down 2.3 per cent to pound(s)15.66 on profit taking after a trading statement on Thursday that was as strong as predicted . Piper Jaffary , which cut Autonomy to "" neutral , "" worried that deals might have been pulled forward to help beat forecasts and argued that hopes of a bid from Microsoft looked unlikely both on strategy and price . Among the mid-caps , DSG International rose 1 per cent to 27p after SocGen added the retailer to its "" buy "" list , encouraged by the fact that most of DSG 's management was taking up a share scheme that swapped basic salary for three-year options priced at 28.4p apiece . Condom maker SSL International , the subject of takeover theories , added 1.2 per cent to 638 1/2 p after a push from Nomura . "" The market continues to underestimate the Chinese opportunity , medium-term prospects in Russia and increased take-out probability , "" said Nomura , which added that SSL could be worth 900p to a predator .

15-05-2013,791,"Verizon / Vodafone Conspiracy theorists alert . Verizon Wireless 's declaration of a $7bn dividend to be paid next month to its owners - Verizon Communications and the UK 's Vodafone - was subject yesterday to as many intricate interpretations as Elvis 's death . Those buying into speculation that Verizon is poised to bid for the 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone seemed understandably deflated at first . After all , if the ink is virtually dry on bid documents , why bother with this nicety ? Moreover , for those convinced that Vodafone is being recalcitrant , the tactic of not paying dividends to push the UK group into negotiations had suddenly been tossed away . But such spirits refused to be discouraged for long . Of course , they quickly reasoned , this was an effort to take the issue of this year 's dividend off the table and allow negotiations over valuation between Verizon and Vodafone to progress unimpeded . Not convinced ? Try this instead . The payout is an "" olive branch "" , oiling relations between the two boards . Same conclusion : sale talks will proceed more smoothly . It is all a bit of a nonsense . Vodafone and Verizon may , indeed , try to resolve the relationship , but immediate pressure on the former is not obvious - nor are there many better alternative investments than Verizon Wireless at present . Vis a vis its dividend declaration , a much simpler fact is that Verizon Communications will find it easier to maintain its own payout ( annual cost near $6bn ) if cash is pushed upstream from the now lowly geared mobile offshoot ( even if executives stressed recently that this was not a necessity ) . What Vodafone does with the funds is more debatable . It has paid out part of the Verizon Wireless dividend stream previously , but with a stock buyback already under way that looks less certain this time . Some extra cash on Vodafone 's balance sheet would not go amiss .",verizonvodafone

12-11-2008,795,"Vodafone 's Colao signals more cautious approach Vittorio Colao , new chief executive of Vodafone , outlined a shift in strategy for the company yesterday by signalling a more cautious approach to deals compared with his predecessors . He indicated that Vodafone 's expansion into developing countries might be close to completion by saying there were few new large markets that interested him . Vodafone 's shares closed up 6.2 per cent at 115p after the world 's largest mobile phone operator by revenue confirmed it would stick to its operating profit target of pound(s)11bn to pound(s)11.5bn for 2008-09 , albeit thanks to favourable exchange rate movements . At Vodafone 's first-half results , Mr Colao also pleased investors by raising its target for free cash flow - broadly , operating cash flow minus capital expenditure - to pound(s)5.2bn-pound(s)5.7bn for 2008-09 , by cutting costs . The previous target was pound(s)5.1bn-pound(s)5.6bn. Explaining his conservative approach to deals , Mr Colao said any large acquisition would probably have to be funded through disposals . Analysts said it was the first time Vodafone had taken such a stance . Vodafone wants to see consolidation between mobile operators in its existing markets , notably Europe , and Mr Colao said the company was willing , for the first time , to buy rivals . However , he also said Vodafone might sell businesses . His comments contrasted with the ambitious acquisitions pursued by Sir Christopher Gent and Arun Sarin , his predecessors . Mr Colao is focused on maximising revenue opportunities in existing markets and cutting costs by pound(s)1bn by 2010-11 . He said he wanted to make Vodafone "" simpler "" and "" faster "" , so as to cope with rising economic , competitive and regulatory pressures . "" My ambition is to lead Vodafone in an industry I do believe is still attractive , and to fully explore . . . Vodafone 's strong advantages in brand , scale and assets , "" Mr Colao said . Vodafone 's revenue rose 17.1 per cent to pound(s)19.9bn in the six months to September 30 . Ad-justed operating profit rose 10.5 per cent to pound(s)5.8bn , fuelled by sterling 's weakness against the euro and the dollar . On an underlying basis , operating profit fell 1 per cent . Pre-tax profit fell 27.3 per cent to pound(s)3.3bn , partly because of a pound(s)1.7bn impairment charge on Vodafone 's troubled Turkish business . Mr Colao announced changes to Vodafone 's dividend policy by abandoning the practice of paying out 60 per cent of earnings . Vodafone is promising a "" progressive "" policy , but analysts expressed disappointment that the full-year dividend was likely to rise by less than their previous estimates .

26-05-2007,797,"Vodafone 's margins set to fall Vodafone is expected to say next week that its core profit margin will continue to fall in the current financial year , as the world 's largest mobile phone group by revenue fights fierce competition in its European markets . Leading industry analysts said Vodafone was likely to indicate at its 2006-07 results presentation on Tuesday that the group 's margin would deteriorate further in the year to March 31 2008 . Vodafone yesterday declined to comment . Terence Sinclair , analyst at Citigroup , also forecast that Vodafone would persist with its strategy of doing deals in emerging markets and said it could buy the 50 per cent of its South African joint venture that it does not own for Pounds 5.2bn. Vodafone warned in May last year that its margin on organic adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation should decline by one percentage point in 2006-07 , continuing a trend that began in 2005-06 . The deteriorating margin position highlighted at Vodafone 's half- year results in November 2005 put pressure on Arun Sarin , the group 's chief executive , although his relations with investors have since recovered . Vodafone 's shares closed at 151.6p last night , down 0.3 per cent . They have risen more than 30 per cent since last September . Analysts said the most important issue for Mr Sarin at Tuesday 's results was the financial guidance for 2007-08 , and establishing how hard Vodafone would be hit by competition in Europe . Nick Delfas , Morgan Stanley analyst , said the 2006-07 results should meet market expectations , but predicted 2007-08 would look "" less good "" . In a research note , he estimated revenue of Pounds 31.2bn for 2006-07 , up 6.5 per cent , and ebitda of Pounds 12bn , up 1.8 per cent , delivering a margin of 38.3 per cent . But Mr Delfas , who has a "" buy "" rating on Vodafone , calculated the margin would fall to 37.5 per cent in 2007-08 .

21-10-2013,805,"Vodafone 's special payout poised to bolster dividend payments in UK to record pound(s)100bn Gross dividend payments from UK companies are set to exceed pound(s)100bn next year for the first time , according to research from Capita Asset Services , writes Alison Smith . The record payout will be boosted by the pound(s)16.6bn special dividend from Vodafone , the study points out . Altogether , the telecoms group is handing shareholders just over pound(s)54bn - almost three-quarters of the net proceeds from the sale of its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless . Next year 's total should also include pound(s)200m in dividends from Royal Mail , which was privatised this month . Without the Vodafone payment , the Capita research suggests that the outlook for dividend growth is far gloomier than the double-digit percentage increases seen in 2011 and 2012 . Capita says that , while dividend payments in the third quarter typically outstrip those paid in the second quarter , this year the headline payments to the end of October totalled pound(s)25.3bn - lower than the distribution in the three months to end of June . This is the first time since 2008 that the third quarter has not been the period of the largest dividend payout . Year-on-year growth had also slowed with the 6.6 per cent increase in underlying dividends over the third quarter of 2012 , lagging behind the 7.7 per cent rise in the first half of 2013 against last year . As a result of this slowdown , Capita has once again nudged down its forecast for total dividends paid out this year - to pound(s)79.7bn - since its previous target would require a much stronger uptick in fourth-quarter payments than is likely . If the new forecast is accurate , it would represent the first dip in dividend payments since 2010 . "" Profits of the UK 's main companies have not yet shown strong signs of recovery . Indeed , they have been falling quite sharply over the last year across a wide variety of sectors as the sluggish economy has meant minimal pricing power , while costs of all kinds have been increasing , putting a squeeze on margins , "" Capita says . But profits are still larger than dividend payments and many companies can call on the cash piles they have built up during the past couple of years to sustain dividend increases ahead of earnings growth . Regular dividends are a much bigger feature this year than they were in 2012 , when one-off income payments of pound(s)6.8bn enabled companies to respond to shareholder calls for cash without getting locked into a progressive ordinary dividend policy that might be difficult to maintain .

17-11-2012,807,"Vodafone ( VOD ) The mobile phone group 's hefty loss reflects a pound(s)5.9bn impairment charge against its struggling Spanish and Italian operations Good news for the UK operator came from a bumper pound(s)2.4bn dividend from US operator Verizon Wireless , in which Vodafone owns 45 per cent in a joint venture with Verizon Communications . Vodafone 's management will use the cash to fund a pound(s)1.5bn share buy-back programme . Cash profits attributable to Vodafone from Verizon Wireless rose 14 per cent in the period to pound(s)4.49bn - which helped adjusted group operating profit rise 2.2 per cent to pound(s)6.2bn. Emerging markets were also relatively strong - particularly Turkey - but sharp falls in southern Europe wiped out those gains . Progress at offsetting declines in voice and messaging revenues looks slow , too . Mobile data revenue climbed 4 per cent to pound(s)1.64bn in the second quarter and voice and messaging combined saw revenue slump 14 per cent to pound(s)6.87bn. Broker Bernstein forecasts full-year adjusted earnings per share of 15.25p ( 14.91p in 2012 ) , rising to 15.79p in 2014 .

13-09-2011,809,"Vodafone Vodafone investors would annoy Mr Spock : they keep acting illogically . On Monday , shares in the UK mobile operator fell 2 per cent after Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture with Verizon Communications , ruled out regular dividends . This comes after a 5 per cent jump in July , when the joint venture announced a $10bn dividend - its first since 2005 . Investors should not make decisions based on dividend announcements as , ceteris paribus , their payment does not affect a company 's valuation . And in this case , it would only make a difference if Vittorio Colao , chief executive , could use the money more efficiently than Verizon Wireless and could not source it more cheaply elsewhere . Vodafone , however , generates so much cash that it might as well be a printing press - Mr Colao had to make a pound(s)2bn special payment to Vodafone shareholders just to deal with the $4.5bn received from its share of July 's Verizon Wireless dividend . Any further distributions would probably go straight through Vodafone in the same way . Some investors who stayed loyal to Vodafone during the acrimonious years after 2005 may scoff at Verizon 's reason for cutting future dividends - that it wants to stockpile cash for capital expenditure ( mainly on radio spectrum ) or acquisitions . It is not a secret that Verizon stopped paying dividends in an effort to force Vodafone to sell its stake in the successful joint venture to Verizon . But since then Verizon Wireless 's trapped cash has been put to good use repaying its debt and Vodafone and Verizon both have new chiefs , who have bonded better than their predecessors ( they have been bike riding together ) . That suggests Mr Colao trusts Verizon 's plans . So the issue is whether Vodafone shareholders trust Mr Colao . So far , he deserves trust . And that means that a US dividend should be far from the front of investors ' minds .",vodafone
14-11-2012,811,"Vodafone Mixed messages rarely make investors comfortable . Interim results at Vodafone were full of them . On the minus side , underlying service revenues fell 1.4 per cent year on year in the second quarter . That was partly a result of weak results in Spain and Italy where regulatory price pressures combined with poor economic trends ( and a further pound(s)6bn in impairments ) . Few surprises there . But Vodafone 's revenue growth also slowed from first-quarter levels in Germany , partly because of local competition , and there was a 3.2 per cent decline in the UK . Result : the first quarterly fall in underlying service revenues since 2009-10 . First-half earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , at pound(s)6.6bn , also disappointed , mainly from European weakness , while the ebitda margin slipped to 30.5 per cent , compared with 31.2 per cent a year ago ( once restructuring and foreign exchange were excluded ) . Conversely , there was a better contribution than expected from the US , where 45 per cent-owned Verizon Wireless said on Monday it would pay an $8.5bn dividend to its two parents . The amount is slightly less than expected , but that seems to be a trade-off for an earlier payout , and Vodafone will return pound(s)1.5bn to investors via a share buyback . The non-European interests also posted good growth , while net debt remained a reasonable 1.8 times ebitda . So full-year guidance was held , albeit with small refinements . Like its peers , Vodafone has a well-articulated vision based around consumers ' appetite for data-based services , businesses ' need for comprehensive account management , and a portfolio of emerging market interests . It has also set a pound(s)300m cost-saving target for 2013-14 . But until the European outlook clears , its shares - down 2 per cent yesterday , implying an enterprise value to 2013-14 ebitda ratio of eight - may struggle to make progress .",vodafone
19-05-2010,813,"Vodafone Growth engines are all very well until they start to sputter . There was back-slapping all round three years ago when Vodafone paid $11bn for a controlling stake in an Indian operator . Yes , it was pricey , but only 13 per cent of India 's population had mobile phones and revenue growth was running at about 50 per cent . How could it lose ? Arun Sarin , chief executive , promised that return on invested capital would exceed the local cost of capital in five years . That is not going to happen , as Vodafone 's pound(s)2.3bn writedown on its Indian business yesterday made clear . Even though operators have been adding customers at a ferocious rate , the capricious government has allowed more than a dozen of them to set up shop and blocked market consolidation . The ensuing price war has made India miserable for everyone ( except , of course , consumers ) . The growth rate of Vodafone 's Indian revenue , which accounts for less than a 10th of its total sales , slowed to 13 per cent last year and was less than half that in the final quarter . Though Vodafone whinges , it is partly responsible : in 2007 it set up an infrastructure-sharing system that reduced costs but also lowered barriers to entry . India 's allure remains . The economy and population are growing rapidly and still only half have phones . But toughing it out will be expensive . Prices in third-generation spectrum auctions have shot through the roof and regulators want to charge retroactively for 2G spectrum too . Vodafone is pinning its hopes on the market consolidating . But it is not clear when the regulator will allow that , nor is it clear how many operators a market such as India 's will ultimately sustain - fewer than a dozen , certainly , but not necessarily the three to four common in Europe . Finally , customers used to the cheapest phone calls in the world will not accept price rises willingly . Spark plug , anyone ?",vodafone
22-05-2013,815,"Vodafone Know that feeling when the crackling phone connection clears and the caller no longer seems to be oceans deep ? Vodafone 's full-year earnings yesterday were like that . At first sight , the numbers were hardly cause for celebration . Underlying revenues from phone services were down more than 4 per cent year-on-year in the final three months to March , the weakest quarterly result to date . But this was no worse than markets feared . The UK and Germany were particularly poor but were offset by better than expected growth outside Europe . Moreover , a nadir may have been reached . Easter timing and leap year effects will now unwind and comparisons ease . Come late 2013-14 , regulatory-related pricing pressures should also lessen . Ahead of mobile termination rate cuts , last year 's underlying service revenues would have been flat and while such cuts may knock another 2 percentage points off service revenue growth this year the impact should reduce sharply in 2014/15 . So , with Vodafone looking to take pound(s)300m out of European operating expenses this year and seeing good growth in data usage , executives are projecting a 2013/14 operating profit of pound(s)12bn-pound(s)12.8bn. That implies a slight improvement and should be eminently do-able . For investors , little changes . The latest pound(s)2.1bn payout from Verizon Wireless is kept to pay for spectrum . But dividends are pledged to stay at current levels , giving a 5.5 per cent yield . If Vodafone fancies acquisitions , net debt is pound(s)27bn , just twice earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , and executives say they could accept a rating downgrade for the right deal . As for the relationship with Verizon , that may be a work in progress . On an earnings basis , Vodafone shares are no steal . But speculation , and sum-of-the-parts valuations , should underpin them .",vodafone
23-07-2011,817,"Vodafone The task for Vodafone is simple - it just has to do two things at once . In its first-quarter results on Friday , the UK-based mobile operator confirmed the complete dichotomy it faces in its markets . On one hand , its emerging markets are racing along . Revenues in Turkey increased 32 per cent and India were up by 17 per cent ( although intense competition there limits profitability ) . On the flip side , the mature European business - which contributes about 70 per cent of revenues - barely grew as it nursed revenue falls of 10 per cent in Spain and 16 per cent in Greece . Cautious but confident investors pushed the share price up 2 per cent . Despite the trouble in Europe , many shareholders are encouraged by the hints that Verizon Wireless , Vodafone 's US joint venture with Verizon , will start paying dividends again next year . Vodafone generated pound(s)7bn of free cash flow in its last financial year . Dividends from Verizon Wireless could increase this by 45 per cent , according to analysts Sanford Bernstein . But this embarrassment of riches could prove a problem . Vodafone is already underleveraged . At the end of June , its net debt of pound(s)23bn was only 1.6 times the company 's expected earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation next year . A pound(s)4bn share buy-back programme now under way will increase that figure to 1.8 times - which would remain about 10 per cent below the company 's target . Figuring out a use for all the extra cash from the dividends could be a pain . Vodafone 's own history includes several large acquisitions that proved hard to integrate . While chief executive Vittorio Colao could merely expand the share buy-back programme , investors might interpret that as a sign that he has run out of ideas . As with investors in many technology companies , Vodafone shareholders may have to grow used to being heavily invested in cash .",vodafone
30-07-2011,819,"Vodafone Talk about having the last laugh . Verizon has long looked to its successful US Verizon Wireless business to prop up its declining fixed-line earnings . And it has long eyed the 45 per cent stake in the unit owned by Vodafone . But having spent six years trying to starve out the UK operator by freezing dividend payments , it has now given up . Unable to cover its own dividend , Verizon has been forced to declare a $10bn payment from the wireless unit , $4.5bn of which goes straight to Vodafone . In response , the latter 's share price jumped up 5 per cent on Friday . The problem for both companies is that multibillion-dollar decisions have been made based purely on the desire for dividends . Their payment means nothing to a company 's valuation . The frequent complaints by many Vodafone shareholders at the lack of dividends from Verizon Wireless are confusing , as the unit 's cash has been put to good use paying down debt . That makes the resumption of dividends more of a moral victory than a financial one . After all , there was never any uncertainty the investment was going to provide a return ; it could always have been sold if necessary . Even if Verizon Wireless paid Vodafone $4.5bn a year for the last six years , the $27bn received would merely have reduced the value of the US investment - currently about $70bn - by the same amount . Vodafone 's chief executive Vittorio Colao had much pressure on him to return cash to investors , but his decision to return pound(s)2bn of the dividend to shareholders is not a cave-in . His company is in great financial shape and there are few acquisition targets . He will also be happy that the illogical gap between Vodafone 's sum-of-the-parts valuation and its depressed market capitalisation has narrowed - even if it occurred for the wrong reason .",vodafone

On Tuesday , Vodafone wrote to the Bombay Stock Exchange and the India 's markets regulator to object to plans by Essar , which holds 33 per cent of Vodafone Essar , to merge 11 per cent of its stake into India Securities ( ISL ) , a small public company . "" Vodafone does not wish a company in which it holds a majority interest to become the subject of a false market , "" said the UK group , which acquired a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar , now known as Vodafone Essar , in 2007 . "" Vodafone is concerned that the value of ISL could be misinterpreted as a fair market value of Vodafone Essar . "" ISL is a highly illiquid vehicle and post-merger more than 95 per cent of the shares will be under the control of the Essar Group and two other shareholders . Accordingly , small amounts of buying or selling could distort ISL 's share price , "" Vodafone added . Essar , which has an option until May to sell its 33 per cent stake in the venture to Vodafone for $5bn , or sell a smaller stake at market value , said that the UK group had no power to change its plans to merge Essar 's telecoms business with ISL . "" Vodafone is neither a shareholder nor a creditor of India Securities or Essar Telecommunications Holdings and as such have nothing to do with this merger scheme , "" Essar said . "" We have received their communication and are studying it and will respond appropriately . "" Vodafone 's falling out with its Indian partner further sours its experience in the country , which has been fraught with difficulties . The British group has been involved in a protracted legal battle with the Indian authorities , who are pursuing Vodafone for $2.5bn in back tax related to its 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Essar for $11bn . In addition , senior government officials have said that Vodafone might have to pay $1bn in retrospective 2G radio spectrum fees . Although the UK group insists that no tax is due and it opposes the Indian telecoms regulator 's proposal for retrospective fees , analysts in India said it faces the risk that it might have to reach a settlement to end the dispute . Vodafone has been struggling to boost its profits in India amid a price war that has hit its revenues and margins .

4-02-2011,829,"Vodafone bolstered by strong UK performance mobile & telecoms ; Concern at Verizon iPhone impact Vodafone reported solid third-quarter sales on the back of strong performances by its UK , Indian and Turkish businesses . The mobile phone operator said on Thursday it expected adjusted operating profit for 2010-11 to be towards the upper end of its target of pound(s)11.8bn to pound(s)12.2bn. However , Vodafone emphasised that the operating profits guidance did not take account of the impact of Apple iPhone sales at Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which it holds a 45 per cent stake . Verizon Wireless will begin selling Apple 's iPhone on February 10 and it is expected to incur costs by subsidising the smartphone so customers pay less for the device than its wholesale price . Analysts at Citigroup said Vodafone 's 2010-11 operating profit could fall to the bottom end of its target range if Verizon Wireless sold 2.5m iPhones by March 31 . However , Verizon Wireless should ultimately benefit from selling the iPhone because it should provide a significant revenue boost . For the three months to December 31 , Vodafone reported group revenue of pound(s)11.9bn , up 3 per cent on the same period in 2009 . Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said Vodafone was "" executing effectively against our strategy "" . Vodafone 's European service revenue , which excludes handset sales , rose 0.2 per cent on an underlying basis in the third quarter . The star performer in western Europe was the UK business , which recorded underlying sales growth of 7 per cent in the third quarter .

20-12-2006,831,"Vodafone books Pounds 100m on Pounds 1.8bn sale of Swisscom Mobile TELECOMMUNICATIONS Vodafone has agreed to sell its 25 per cent stake in Switzerland 's leading mobile phone operator for Pounds 1.8bn , as it continues to dispose of some of its minority shareholdings in wireless companies . Swisscom , Switzerland 's dominant telecommunications company , is to pay Vodafone SFr4.25bn for its stake in Swisscom Mobile . Although Vodafone said it would use the Pounds 1.8bn to reduce its net debt of Pounds 20.2bn , some analysts predicted the sale proceeds could help finance expansion in emerging markets such as Africa , Asia and eastern Europe . Vodafone said its guidance of free cash flow of Pounds 4.7bn to Pounds 5.2bn for 2006-07 would have to be revised down because it would no longer receive Pounds 100m of dividend payments from Swisscom Mobile . Vodafone is to record a exceptional gain of Pounds 100m in its next results on the disposal of the Swisscom Mobile stake , which represents the difference between the sale price and the book value . Vodafone paid SFr4.5bn for the stake in 2001 . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , said : "" We do not . . . see ourselves as the most appropriate holder of this minority stake in the longer term and Swisscom is keen to increase its holding in Swisscom Mobile . "" Analysts at Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley said Vodafone had secured an attractive price , implyinga multiple of nine times the operator 's forecast core earnings for 2007 . Vodafone has been tidying up its portfolio of businesses in western Europe , where fierce competition and pressure from regulators for price cuts has resulted in slowing revenue growth and declining profit margins . It sold its 25 per cent stake in Proximus , Belgium 's leading mobile operator , for Euros 2bn in November . Swisscom will hold 100 per cent of Swisscom Mobile 's equity after the deal . Carsten Schloter , Swisscom 's chief executive , said the transaction would boost the group 's earnings per share by 10 per cent and enhance its strategy for fixed-line and mobile convergence .

9-11-2011,833,"Vodafone boosts full-year guidance mobile & telecoms Vodafone raised its outlook for full-year operating profit on the back of a stronger performance than expected in most of its big markets , which outweighed a pound(s)450m charge in its embattled Greek operations . The mobile group 's results highlighted the disparity of economic conditions across the European Union , with better performances than expected outside the southern European countries , and strengths in the US and India . Vodafone expects full-year operating profit to come at the top end of its range outlined in May , partly because of a strong performance by Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which it has a 45 per cent stake . The UK group 's sales and operating profit were ahead of analysts ' expectations . Vodafone reported revenue of pound(s)23.5bn for the six months to September 30 , up 4.1 per cent from the same time last year , and underlying operating profit of pound(s)6bn , down 0.6 per cent . Pre-tax profit fell 2.8 per cent to pound(s)8.01bn , partly because of higher financing costs and lower investment income after it sold minority stakes in Chinese and Japanese mobile operators . Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said only Spain was proving a serious drag on the company , given pressure on pricing there and the need for restructuring . He said the writedown on Vodafone 's Greek business was almost half that of a year ago . The company remained in talks with Wind Hellas , one of the other two operators in the Greek market , about a potential merger , Mr Colao confirmed . Rollout of next generation LTE superfast mobile services in Germany was proceeding well , he said , and he played down future capital expenditure requirements , with the move to data services rather than voice calls over its networks a big part in being able to push prices higher . Mr Colao highlighted how Vodafone had secured a pound(s)2.8bn dividend from Verizon Wireless , its first for seven years , on which it would pay a special dividend of 4p in February . The interim dividend is set at 3.05p , up 7 per cent on last year . * FT Comment In spite of the Greek charge and exposure to southern European economies , Vodafone remains one of the best haven stocks in the FTSE 100 , given a growing dividend yielding 7.5 per cent and strength elsewhere in its spread of businesses . With prices underpinned by a shift to data tariffs , a positive medium-term outlook of an Indian business being lined up for an IPO , and the likelihood of a further dividend next year from Verizon Wireless , the stock , up 3.15p to 176p , remains a good buy for the short term and could be due a longer-term rerating against peers .

4-07-2008,835,"Vodafone buys Ghana Telecom stake MOBILE & TELECOMS Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile phone company , yesterday agreed to buy a 70 per cent stake in Ghana Telecom for $900m , gaining a controlling stake in Africa 's eighth largest mobile network . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's outgoing chief executive , described Ghana as "" one of the most attractive markets in Africa "" and pointed to mobile subscriptions rising at more than 55 per cent a year , while mobile penetration is a low 35 per cent . The government of Ghana was one of the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to undertake a programme of liberalisation in the telecommunications sector . Ghana Telecom operates the country 's third largest mobile carrier , with 1.4m customers and a one-third market share , and a fixed-line service , while a fibre optic network that covers urban areas such as Accra has also been included in the deal . Ghana Telecom posted 2007 earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortisation of $42m on sales of $290m , Vodafone said . Ghana 's ruling New Patriotic party has been keen to finalise the sale of Ghana Telecom ahead of elections in December . In spite of a reputation as one of the best-run economies in Africa , the government has a growing budget deficit . Analysts say the sale of Ghana Telecom will provide some relief for the government ahead of the campaign period . The prospect of oil wealth has turned the polls into one of the highest-stakes contests since independence in 1957 . Whoever wins will oversee Ghana 's entry into the club of significant African crude exporters from newly discovered offshore oilfields . Ghana Telecom reported revenue growth of 9.3 per cent in the 12 months ended December 31 last year to $290m and earnings of $42m . John Davies , an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in London , said the few numbers available and government ownership had made it difficult to value . "" Vodafone appears to have paid a high price , based on a trailing earnings multiple of 30 times , "" he said . "" But , in a Vodafone context , $900m is a small percentage of its market capitalisation . It 's more about what you can do with it in the next two to three years , "" he said . Mr Sarin has identified Africa as one of Vodafone 's key targets for growth , having expanded its position in India last year . The Ghanaian government will retain a 30 per cent stake . Ghana Telecom will also invest more than $500m in its operations and network . Vodafone shares closed down 0.4p at 152p .

27-07-2011,837,"Vodafone chief eyes Verizon dividend MOBILE & TELECOMS Vodafone , the telecoms group , on Tuesday used its annual meeting to claim vindication of its strategy of refusing to sell its minority stake in Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile phone operator . Sir John Bond used his last speech as Vodafone 's chairman to highlight how Verizon Communications , Verizon Wireless ' controlling shareholder , has said the mobile operator is due to resume making dividend payments in 2012 , seven years after the parents last received a pay-out . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , endorsed comments by Lowell McAdam , his incoming counterpart at Verizon Communications , who last week said he did not envisage the UK and US groups combining . Mr Colao also disclosed that Sir John had last year urged him not to yield to pressure from some shareholders for a rapid sale of Vodafone 's minority stakes in overseas mobile operators . Ontario Teachers Pension Fund , the activist shareholder , used Vodafone 's annual meeting in July last year to unsuccessfully call for Sir John 's removal and a restructuring of the group . Mr Colao said Sir John had secured a "" few extra millions "" for Vodafone 's shareholders by telling him not to rush into selling its minority stakes . Since last September , Vodafone has finalised sales of minority stakes in Chinese , Japanese , French and Polish mobile operators . But Vodafone has retained its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless , after rejecting an offer in 2006 by Verizon Communications to buy the UK group out of their joint venture . Verizon Communications blocked dividend payments by Verizon Wireless in 2005 , in a move widely seen as an attempt to squeeze out Vodafone . But Verizon Communications is expected to approve a resumption of dividend payments by Verizon Wireless later this year because otherwise the controlling shareholder could have to cut its group pay-out , according to some analysts . Sir John said of Verizon Wireless at the annual meeting : "" The prospect for dividends is now very good , with Verizon 's management confirming a pay-out in 2012 . "" He told the Financial Times later : "" The policy not to sell five years ago has been vindicated . "" Andy Halford , Vodafone 's finance director , said analysts ' valuations of the Verizon Wireless stake had increased from about $20bn in 2001 to $65bn-$70bn ( pound(s)40bn-pound(s)43bn ) in 2011 . Sir John said the "" huge challenge "" he was leaving behind at Vodafone was how to unlock the value of its stake in Verizon Wireless , given it represented about 45 per cent of the UK group 's market capitalisation . "" We do need to reflect very , very carefully on all the possibilities , "" he said . See People Credit : By Andrew Parker",vodafone chief eyes verizon dividend

Mr Sarin suffered embarrassment when investors with 15 per cent of Vodafone 's shares either voted against his re-election as chief executive or abstained at the mobile phone company 's annual meeting . It is thought to be the biggest protest against a Vodafone director to date . The company suffered further discomfort when investors holding 20.2 per cent of its shares voted against its remuneration policy or abstained . Sir John said he "" subscribed "" to comments by Lord MacLaurin , Vodafone 's outgoing chairman , who voiced strong support for Mr Sarin but warned he had to deliver results on the company 's new strategy . Some of Vodafone 's big investors critical of Mr Sarin look to Sir John , former chairman of HSBC , for a swift review of the board , and to decide whether to replace the chief executive . Sir John said : "" Wherever you work in the world , the performance of management is under constant review . "" Mr Sarin 's re-election as chief executive was opposed by three of Vodafone 's top 10 investors : Hermes Pension Management , Morley Fund Management and Standard Life Investments . Some big investors also abstained . Some investors have become increasingly critical of Mr Sarin since Vodafone warned last November of slowing revenue growth and reduced profit margins . In May it announced a record pre-tax loss for its 2006 fiscal year of Pounds 14.9bn. Mr Sarin , who insisted he was listening to investors , said : "" 85 per cent of the people who voted said ' the strategy of the firm , the direction of the firm , is fine' .

Investors with 6 per cent of Vodafone 's shares voted against re- election of Luc Vandevelde , chairman of the remuneration committee , or abstained .

28-01-2010,841,"Vodafone chief under pressure over European businesses Mobile & Telecoms ; News analysis ; Shareholders also seek end to the impasse at Verizon Wireless , writes Andrew Parker The pressure is rising on Vittorio Colao . Investors see little or no evidence of progress on the Vodafone chief executive 's pledge to turn round the company 's underperforming European mobile phone businesses . Some shareholders are also seeking an end to the impasse at Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake . Verizon Communications , the US telecoms company that owns the other 55 per cent , has blocked dividend payments by Verizon Wireless since 2005 . Mr Colao became chief executive of the UK-based mobile operator in July 2008 . Since then Vodafone 's shares have underperformed the FTSE Eurofirst 300 telecoms index by 4 per cent . Investors say he risks facing calls for a break-up of the company if he does not close the gap between its market capitalisation and analysts ' sum-of-the-parts valuations . Analysts at Bernstein estimate Vodafone 's shares are trading at about a 30 per cent discount to the fair value of the company 's controlled assets . That compares with an average discount of 25 per cent for European telecoms companies . But after factoring in a resumption of dividends from Verizon Wireless , the analysts say Vodafone 's shares are trading at a 40 per cent discount . One investor questions whether Vodafone 's mature European businesses and growing emerging markets assets should be owned by one company . He adds that Mr Colao must either "" accept a slimmed-down Vodafone as a way forward for the group or come out with a defence as to why all the assets fit together "" . Another investor says : "" Talk of a break-up will be on the agenda if [ Colao ] does n't start to perform . "" However , investors are not about to repeat the revolt mounted against Arun Sarin , Mr Colao 's predecessor , in 2005-2006 . Shareholders like how Mr Colao used his first strategy presentation in November 2008 to say he would focus on improving the performance of Vodafone 's businesses , notably on cash generation . But shareholders were alarmed by how Vodafone 's European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of group sales , for the first time reported falling underlying revenue in 2008-2009 . The decline is not just because of the downturn . Since Mr Colao became chief executive , Vodafone 's businesses in Germany , Spain and the UK have lost share to rivals . Vodafone has also run into problems in emerging markets . Its Indian business , for example , has felt obliged to join a price war begun by rivals . However , most investors focus on the stalemate at Verizon Wireless . Last November Mr Colao said the biggest issue confronting him was "" solving the US "" , given it contributed 37 per cent of Vodafone 's earnings but none of its cash flow . Vodafone had been hoping for a resumption of dividends in 2009 after Verizon Wireless paid down its debt , but the timetable was pushed back to 2012 by the acquisition of Alltel , a smaller US mobile operator . Ivan Seidenberg , Verizon Communications ' chairman , used a conference this month to underline his group controlled Verizon Wireless , including questions about cash usage . He held out the possibility of dividend payments resuming some time between 2011 and 2014 , but made no commitment . Mr Seidenberg 's comments underline how Vodafone and Verizon Communications have a tempestuous relationship over Verizon Wireless . Vodafone says it keep its options at Verizon Wireless under regular review , including the case for selling all or part of the stake , which Citi analysts value at pound(s)27.5bn ( $44.5bn ) . Vodafone has received legal advice that selling the stake could incur a large tax bill , which means it may simply have to wait for dividend payments in 2012 .

29-03-2010,843,"Vodafone claims gains in Verizon Wireless talks News analysis ; Talks with US mobile operator may be entering an end game as joint-venture debt is paid down , says Andrew Parker Vodafone is increasingly confident that the balance of power in its tempestuous relationship with Verizon Communications is shifting in the UK mobile phone group 's favour . Vodafone thinks its negotiating position with Verizon Communications over the future of Verizon Wireless , the US mobile phone operator that the two groups own jointly , is getting stronger , according to people familiar with the UK company . Verizon Communications , the US telecoms group that owns 55 per cent of Verizon Wireless , has blocked the mobile operator from making dividend payments since 2005 , so it can pay down debt . Vodafone owns the other 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless and has been trying , so far without success , to secure a restoration of dividends . Verizon Wireless generates about 30 per cent of the UK group 's earnings but contributes no cash . The lack of dividends is one reason for tension between Verizon Communications and Vodafone . Another source of friction is Verizon Communications ' wish to secure full ownership of Verizon Wireless , which is the largest mobile operator in the US . On-off talks between Verizon Communications and Vodafone about the future of Verizon Wireless may finally be entering an end game , however , because the mobile operator is expected to be debt-free by the end of next year . Vodafone has been urging its shareholders to be patient , even though some have long been unhappy about the lack of Verizon Wireless ' dividends . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's former chief executive , suffered a mini-investor rebellion over the issue at the UK group 's 2007 annual meeting . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive since 2008 , is also facing calls to break the Verizon Wireless impasse , but he may be in a more comfortable situation than his predecessor . People familiar with Vodafone claimed the UK company 's wait-and-see strategy could be vindicated by an increasingly strong negotiating position on Verizon Wireless , although they cautioned that no decisions have been taken . Verizon Communications paid a dividend worth $5.3bn in 2009 and Bernstein analysts said that problems at the US group 's fixed-line phone business meant that it will need to tap Verizon Wireless ' cash so as to maintain its shareholder remuneration . Craig Moffett and Robin Bienenstock , who cover US and European telecoms companies respectively for Bernstein , said in a research note : "" For Verizon , time is running out . Vittorio Colao holds the cards . And he seems to know it . "" Vodafone has been mulling three options on Verizon Wireless : securing a resumption of dividend payments , selling its stake in the business , or merging with Verizon Communications . The UK group 's willingness to countenance an all-share merger with Verizon Communications is partly based on legal advice that any sale of Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless stake would attract a large tax liability . However , one person familiar with Vodafone said a merger was not attractive , partly because of a lack of synergies between the US and UK groups . The Bernstein analysts expressed doubts that Verizon Communications could finance a purchase of Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless stake , which , after including a tax-related sale premium , they valued at $79bn ( pound(s)53bn ) . Mr Moffett and Ms Bienenstock therefore concluded the most likely outcome was a resumption of Verizon Wireless ' dividend payments . John Killian , Verizon Communications ' finance director , said this month that he could "" handle our dividend "" in 2010 and 2011 without any support from a Verizon Wireless dividend . He said the US group would "" in the next couple of years "" look at the case for restoring Verizon Wireless ' dividend payments in 2012 . "" We are a long way away from when I really need to seriously think about that particular issue , "" he added . Credit : By Andrew Parker",vodafone claims gains in verizon wireless talks
14-02-2012,845,"Vodafone confirms talks with C&WW Shares in troubled group up almost 45 % ; Mobile operator warns offer is not a certainty Shares in Cable & Wireless Worldwide jumped almost 45 per cent after Vodafone confirmed that it was interested in bidding for the troubled telecoms group . The FTSE 100 mobile operator yesterday said it was "" in the very early stages of evaluating the merits of a potential offer for C&W Worldwide "" but added that there was no certainty of an offer being made . Vodafone said in its statement that any bid for the company would be in cash . However , people close to both companies said that there had been no approach made so far . Confirmation of Vodafone 's interest pushed up shares in C&W Worldwide to 28.5p , taking the company 's equity value to more than the pound(s)700m that had been rumoured as a potential purchase price . Vodafone 's interest surprised the market given the troubled financial position of C&W Worldwide , which had been struck by three profit warnings in 12 months after the corporate-focused business was demerged from the consumer side of the Cable & Wireless group in March 2010 . The company 's share price lost three-quarters of its value in a year as a result . Analysts said that Vodafone was likely to be interested in C&W Worldwide 's fixed-line network rather than its cash flow , given the flat margins and falling earnings , with the acquisition providing potential support for Vodafone 's mobile network as greater numbers of customers use bandwidth-hungry data services . There could also be interest in C&W Worldwide 's corporate voice , data and hosting services to bolster Vodafone 's own enterprise business . Even so , people within Vodafone cautioned that the interest was preliminary and there was no certainty that an offer would be made . Mobile operators want to offload as much of the data traffic as possible to fixed lines . Vodafone is already one of BT 's biggest customers , which means there could be cost savings from the acquisition of its own network . However , analysts at Citi also highlighted the execution risk given C&W Worldwide 's poor record of operational performance . It said this "" might make for a contentious choice for Vittorio Colao 's first material acquisition as chief executive and could require sizeable restructuring capex to bring cash returns to an acceptable level "" . Gavin Darby , who previously worked at Vodafone , was appointed C&W Worldwide 's third chief executive in as many years last November . On Thursday , Mr Darby will reveal his initial strategy to return the company to growth again in a trading statement , which is expected to include a focus on higher margin business in corporate services . Analysts also predict a simplification of the company 's structure . Lombard , Page 16 Credit : By Daniel Thomas and Mark Wembridge",vodafone confirms talks with c&ww
25-05-2005,847,"Vodafone cuts growth guidance * Revenue and margins affected by competition Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile phone operator , caused jitters among investors yesterday when it lowered its guidance for margins and revenue growth for the current year amid warnings of intensifying competition . It expects revenue growth of 6-9 per cent , down from "" high single digits "" , and said margins would be flat or down 1 percentage point from 38.5 per cent , rather than its earlier guidance of "" broadly stable "" margins . Arun Sarin , chief executive , said the change in guidance "" reflects a more competitive backdrop "" but said the change was made only to give management more flexibility to compete in key markets . Investors sent shares down 7p or 5 per cent to 139 1/2p . Analysts said the reaction appeared overdone because the core profit guidance had not changed . Mr Sarin said Vodafone was on track to hit its target of 10m third-generation customers by the end of its financial year . "" We do think we can make 10m as handset prices start to come down ( in the second half ) , "" Mr Sarin said . The group has signed up 2.1m customers using 3G phones and 300,000 data card users since rolling out the latest generation of mobile technology across 13 markets last November . Vodafone 's first guidance on 3G take-up will be closely watched by the industry and investors because of concerns that operators will struggle to secure a decent return on 3G . Vodafone added 16.3m net customers in the year to March across 26 markets , giving it a customer base of 154.8m. Vodafone confirmed plans to increase returns to shareholders with a Pounds 4.5bn share buyback programme , up from Pounds 4bn last year , and a doubling of the dividend from 2.03p to 4.07p. Ken Hydon , finance director , said the group 's Pounds 8.3bn net debt load left it with "" plenty of headroom "" to return further cash to shareholders and finance more acquisitions . Mr Sarin said Vodafone could load a further Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn on to its balance sheet without losing its single-A credit rating . He said he was looking to expand in central and eastern Europe in particular and hinted at similar sized acquisitions to the Pounds 2.3bn deal in Romania and the Czech Republic in March . Mr Sarin said the management team put into the troubled Japanese business was on course to get things right . "" We are confident we will turn the business around by the end of this ( financial ) year , "" Mr Sarin said . The company reported turnover up 1.4 per cent to Pounds 34.1bn in the year to March . Earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation rose to Pounds 10.9bn from Pounds 10.7bn.

20-07-2007,849,"Vodafone defends stake Vodafone conceded yesterday there was "" no absolute guarantee "" it would receive dividends from Verizon Wireless , the second-largest US mobile operator , in two years ' time . The world 's largest mobile phone group by revenue has been reassuring investors about the merits of retaining its minority stake in Verizon Wireless by stating dividend payments could resume in about two years . ECS , a rebel Vodafone shareholder , is urging investors to support a resolution at the UK company 's annual meeting next Tuesday calling for the 45 per cent stake to be spun off . ECS argues Verizon Wireless is a "" passive investment "" for Vodafone because it last received a dividend in 2004-05 , worth Pounds 923m . Andy Halford , Vodafone 's chief financial officer , said there was a "" strong logic "" to a resumption of dividend payments because Verizon Wireless should be free of debt in 2009 . But he added : "" There is no absolute guarantee whatever that we will get a dividend flow at that point . It hasto be something mutually agreed by us and Verizon . "" He acknowledged dividends could be reduced or delayed beyond 2009 if Verizon Wireless chose to buy additional mobile spectrum or embarked on deals . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , hinted he was confident that a majority of investors would on Tuesday reject the ECS resolution calling for the company to spin off the Verizon Wireless stake . ECS said it was securing "" good support "" for its Verizon Wireless resolution , particularly from US investors . Mr Sarin said Vodafone continually looked at its strategy on Verizon Wireless , but highlighted how the US mobile operator was performing strongly and that Vodafone 's stake would continue to increase in value . Vodafone and Verizon Communications , the US telecoms company that owns55 per cent of Verizon Wireless , have been unable to resolve an impasse over the mobile operator . Verizon Communications wants full ownership of Verizon Wireless , but has failed to interest Vodafone in selling its stake . The Financial Times ' FT Alphaville website revealed on Monday that Vodafone and its advisers had mulled over a bid for Verizon Communications , as part of an options review , although the UK company later said there were no plans to make an offer . Mr Sarin said yesterday that Vodafone 's board had not considered making a bid . Publishing figures for the three months to June 30 , Vodafone said it generated revenue of Pounds 8.3bn , up 4 per cent on an organic basis .

21-02-2008,851,"Vodafone dragged down by fears of a price war in US By NEIL HUME and ROBERT ORR A poor performance from Vodafone dragged down the London market yesterday . Shares in the mobile phone group were marked 4.7 per cent lower at 162p amid fears of a US price war . On Tuesday , Verizon Wireless , Vodafone 's US joint venture , and AT&T announced new tariffs allowing users to make an unlimited number of calls to any phone in the US for Dollars 100 a month . That news saw shares in Verizon Wireless and AT&T fall sharply overnight on concerns that Sprint Nextel and other operators would respond by slashing prices . Vodafone draws about a quarter of earnings before interest and tax from its 45 per cent holding in Verizon Wireless . Vodafone 's decline weighed on the FTSE 100 , which finished 73.3 points , or 1.2 per cent , lower at 5,893.6. The FTSE 250 slipped 84.2 points , or 0.8 per cent , to 10,124.4. Alliance & Leicester was the biggest blue chip faller . Its shares closed 6.8 per cent lower at 492p as analysts lowered forecasts in the wake of disappointing annual results . Housebuilders were under pressure after Dresdner Kleinwort published a very bearish report ahead of the sector 's reporting season , which gets under way next week . "" It is now clear that results will show a marked slowdown in volumes , prices and incentive pressure and a retreat from the land market , "" the broker said , adding that its forecasts were already at the bottom of the range .

Wolseley , the plumbing and building materials group , shed 3.7 per cent to 653 1/2p after Credit Suisse turned negative . Downgrading to "" underperform "" and setting a 540p target price , analyst George Gregory said Wolseley could breach its banking covenants if the US housing market took another downward lurch . "" We believe macro pressures will stretch Wolseley 's financial position such that Wolseley will have to make a number of potentially difficult decisions with respect to its commitments to banks and shareholders , and its aspirations for growth and investment , "" Mr Gregory said . Kingfisher , owner of the B&Q DIY chain , fell 3.4 per cent to 132p ahead of today 's trading update . "" The challenges ahead of new group chief executive , Ian Cheshire , remain daunting , in our view . We also believe that the property backing argument should be discounted to reflect falling commercial values , "" Investec Securities said , lowering its price target to 115p . SABMiller , the emerging markets brewer , dropped 4.3 per cent to Pounds 10.82 amid talk it had been planning a counter bid for Scottish & Newcastle , up 2.5 per cent to 807 1/2p . S&N has recommended a 800p-a-share offer from Carlsberg and Heineken .

13-06-2013,853,"Vodafone eyes EUR7bn German deal Initial approach for cable group KDG ; UK company keen on wider expansion Vodafone returned to the European acquisition trail with an approach for Kabel Deutschland , Germany 's largest cable operator , to strike a deal potentially worth more than EUR7bn . The preliminary approach marks a return to large continental deals for Vodafone , which is keen to expand outside traditional mobile into cable television and broadband sectors to offer multiple products to its customers . An acquisition of Kabel Deutschland ( KDG ) would be the third-largest UK-led telecoms deal on record , although dwarfed by Vodafone 's last foray into the German market with the controversial $183bn acquisition of Mannesmann in 1999 . Analysts highlighted concerns that Vodafone would embark on a pan-European fixed-line M&A spree to strengthen the British mobile operator 's bundled TV-to-telecoms business . The mobile operator has been linked with various European groups following comments by management that it could partner with , or buy cable operators to gain access to fibre networks . Most analysts also said that synergies and new product growth should offset the potentially high price Vodafone would need to pay in a cable sector that has experienced a boom in valuations amid consolidation activity led by Liberty Global . Shares in KDG are about 45 per cent higher than at the beginning of the year . Vodafone 's interest in the business goes back to 2010 , although it began to talk more formally to the group at the beginning of this year . Talks have become more serious in the past week , according to people familiar with the situation , with the start of initial negotiations over price . KDG has indicated that Vodafone would need to bid "" a significant premium "" on the share price , according to one informed person , even after it rose more than 9 per cent to EUR82 on the back of the announcement yesterday . "" Come back with a premium [ at least in the double digits ] and they would open the door at least , "" he added . Analysts have estimated that an opening offer may need to be up to EUR90 per share , which would value KDG on 12 times earnings estimates for next year . "" Vodafone will have a job convincing its conservative shareholders that they are not paying over the odds , "" said analysts at Olivetree , which said that the price could rise even as high as EUR94 . Vodafone shares fell 5.7 per cent to 181p on confirmation of the talks . The shares were also under selling pressure after they went ex-dividend . Vodafone could pursue a hostile takeover , although it has already experienced the difficulties of such an approach in Germany when it bought Mannesmann .

18-05-2011,855,"Vodafone eyes new round of acquisitions mobile & telecoms ; Group prepared for European action ; Pre-tax profit rises 9.5 % to pound(s)9.5bn Vodafone signalled it is willing to embark on a new round of acquisitions after the mobile phone operator 's full-year results were dented by the economic downturn in southern Europe . Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said on Tuesday the UK group was prepared to buy rivals in its existing European markets after welcoming ambitious plans by AT&T , the US mobile operator , to acquire a key competitor . Vodafone booked pound(s)6.1bn of impairment charges at its 2010-2011 results that reflected its expectation of generating less cash in the future from its businesses in Greece , Italy , Ireland , Portugal and Spain . However , Vodafone 's results reassured investors that the industry was not suffering a broad malaise following a profit warning last month by a European rival . Vodafone reported revenue of pound(s)45.9bn for the year to March 31 , up 3.2 per cent on the previous year , as some of its fast-growing businesses in emerging markets offset weakness in southern Europe . Operating profit excluding one-off items rose 3.1 per cent to pound(s)11.8bn , notably because of a strong performance by Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake . Verizon should benefit from AT&T 's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom , because consolidation provides the remaining operators with greater pricing power . The deal would reduce the number of national network operators in the US from four to three , and Mr Colao said that could set a new global benchmark . Since becoming Vodafone 's chief executive in 2008 , Mr Colao has called a halt to large acquisitions and instead sold some of the group 's minority stakes in overseas operators . However , he said that in Europe "" consolidation would be a good thing . There are a number of situations where I can see consolidation being beneficial to all . "" He added Vodafone was prepared to be an "" active "" participant in consolidation in Europe , where most markets have four operators . The shares closed up 3 1/2 p at 171 3/4 p. Mr Colao also lashed out at the Indian authorities for pursuing Vodafone for $2.5bn ( pound(s)1.5bn ) in capital gains tax on its acquisition of a controlling stake in an Indian mobile business in 2007 . He accused the authorities of behaviour that was "" close to blackmail "" by pursuing the tax claim against the buyer rather than the seller . Pre-tax profit increased 9.5 per cent to pound(s)9.5bn and the total dividend rose 7.1 per cent to 8.9p after a final of 6.05p ( 5.65p ) . Earnings per share were 15.2p , down 7.6 per cent .

30-05-2007,857,"Vodafone eyes selective deals By ANDREW PARKER and PAUL TAYLOR Vodafone is interested in more deals in emerging markets , the UK mobile phone group said yesterday as it reported a4 per cent increase in operating profit in 2006-07 . The group 's shares closed up 5.5 per cent at 159.7p , their highest level since January 2002 , after Vodafone said operating profit would be potentially flat in 2007-08 . The guidance was better than stock marketforecasts . Vodafone has been at the centre of fevered market speculation about consolidation in the telecommunications sector . But people close to AT&T dismissed market rumours that the US company was planning a bid for the UK group . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , insisted there was no logic to breaking up the group , and instead said it was willing to look at more selective acquisitions in Africa , Asia and eastern Europe . Vodafone completed its third largest transaction earlier this month after paying Dollars 10.9bn ( Pounds 5.5bn ) for control of Hutchison Essar , the Indian mobileoperator . Mr Sarin said Vodafone could be interested in buying the 50 per cent of its South African mobile joint venture that it does not own . Telkom , South Africa 's leading telecoms company that owns the other 50 per cent of Vodacom , is reviewing its participation in the venture . Mr Sarin said : "" If they come to us and say would we be interested , we will certainly look at that asset . "" With net debt at Pounds 24.1bn on a pro forma basis following the Hutchison Essar transaction , Vodafone is willing to see its A- credit rating go to BBB+ temporarily if it identifies an appropriate target in emerging markets . Vodafone reported revenue of Pounds 31.1bn for 2006-07 , up 4.3 per cent on an organic basis , and adjusted operating profit of Pounds 9.5bn , up 4.2 per cent . It recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.4bn , partly because of Pounds 11.6bn of impairment charges that reflected fierce competition and regulatory pressure in some of its core European markets . The full year dividend was 6.76p , up 11.4 per cent . Investors welcomed how Vodafone will over the next two years raise its dividend above a payout target of 60 per cent of adjusted earnings per share . The move will offset the dilutive earnings impact of the Hutchison Essar transaction .",vodafone eyes selective deals
15-11-2006,859,"Vodafone eyes small EU targets *Chief takes aim at European bit- players*But group 's results are wide of the mark Vodafone predicted yesterday that some mobile operators would be squeezed out of European markets , and said the group could be interested in buying such businesses . Arun Sarin , chief executive of Vodafone , the world 's biggest mobile operator by revenue , forecast consolidation in European markets because of the ferocity of competition . He said Vodafone would "" look at these assets as they become available "" . He also said Vodafone could expand in emerging markets and raised the prospect of the group increasing its stake in Bharti , India 's biggest mobile operator . Mr Sarin 's upbeat remarks about potential acquisition activity came as Vodafone reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.3bn for the six months to September 30 , compared with a Pounds 3.9bn profit for the same period last year . The loss was principally the result of an Pounds 8.1bn impairment charge on the goodwill of its German and Italian businesses . Vodafone had earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of Pounds 6.2bn for the six months of its 2006-07 fiscal year , up 3 per cent on an organic basis . Revenue was Pounds 15.6bn , up 4 per cent on an organic basis , and free cash flow was Pounds 3bn , down 9 per cent . The interim dividend was 2.35p , up 7 per cent . Vodafone 's shares closed down 0.5p yesterday at 135.5p. Vodafone reiterated its May guidance of slowing revenue growth and a declining profit margin in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 . In the first half of 2006-07 , strong revenue growth in Vodafone 's businesses in emerging markets helped offset falling sales in some of its core European operations . Businesses in eastern Europe , the Middle East , Africa , and Asia reported revenue of Pounds 3.1bn for 2006-07 , up 21 per cent on an organic basis . Mr Sarin predicted Europe would see some smaller mobile operators "" closing their shops and going home "" because , against a backdrop of price cutting , only big players such as Vodafone could realise cost savings through economies of scale . He said consolidation could take place in the UK , the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe . "" We will certainly look at assets within our geographic scope , "" he added . Any deals would have to pass Vodafone 's financial criteria but Mr Sarin said the group would look at Hutchison Whampoa 's mobile businesses in Italy and the UK if they were put up for sale . Mr Sarin also said Vodafone could pursue "" selective acquisitions "" in Africa , Asia and eastern Europe but stressed no businesses had been "" targeted "" . Vodafone has a 10 per cent stake in Bharti , and Mr Sarin said "" over the next several years "" the group could find ways of "" increasing our share "" . He also said Vodafone was keen to maximise its participation in China , where it already has a 3 per cent stake in China Mobile .",vodafone eyes small eu targets *chief takes aim at european bit- players*but group's results are wid

The world 's largest mobile operator by revenue said in October it planned to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom , its 50-50 joint venture with South Africa 's state-controlled Telkom . But yesterday the Communication Workers Union said it would seek to prevent Telkom selling its shares at the high court in Pretoria on Tuesday . "" We are not happy that the [ controlling ] stake is being sold to a foreign company , "" Gallant Roberts , general secretary , told the Financial Times .

The group tried to reassure investors by revealing a new cost-cutting programme worth pound(s)1bn . It also held out the possibility of a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake , in 2011 . Last year Vodafone said a payout was unlikely until 2012 . Shares in Vodafone closed down 2p at 135.95p after it reported revenue of pound(s)21.8bn for the six months to September 30 , an increase of 9 per cent compared with the same period last year , and pre-tax profit up 73 per cent to pound(s)5.75bn. The first-half performance was boosted by sterling 's weakness , acquisitions and a pound(s)1.7bn impairment charge in the equivalent results for 2008-09 . Underlying revenue fell 3 per cent and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation dropped 8 per cent . Vodafone said in May that its ebitda margin should decline by 1.8 percentage points in 2009-10 , but yesterday it said the deterioration was now expected to be 2.1 percentage points . The higher-than-expected decline is partly rooted in a fierce price war between mobile operators in India . Vodafone 's Indian business recorded an ebitda margin of 24 per cent in the first half of 2009-10 , compared with 28.4 per cent in the same period last year . Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said the Indian market had too many mobile operators - the UK group has 11 rivals . Mr Colao said Vodafone was willing to consider buying rivals , but stressed that Indian government rules currently prevented the company from doing so . "" We will look at the opportunities and we will support consolidation , "" he said . Vodafone stuck to its guidance that it will generate pound(s)11bn to pound(s)11.8bn of operating profit in 2009-10 after saying that depreciation and amortisation charges would be lower than expected . It added it will generate up to pound(s)6.5bn of free cash flow . Vodafone had been seeking to cut its operating expenses by pound(s)1bn by 2011 , but the group said it was now planning to hit the target by March 2010 . It will cut expenses by a further pound(s)1bn by March 2012 . The interim dividend rises from 2.57p to 2.66p ; earnings per share were 9.14p ( 4.02p ) .

Vodafone has scaled back its revenue forecast for 2008-09 to pound(s)39.8bn after admitting the economic downturn was hurting its mobile businesses in Spain and the UK . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's outgoing chief executive , insisted Vodafone was confident of the revised revenue guidance and highlighted how it was standing by its original forecast on adjusted operating profit and free cash flow for 2008-09 . Mr Sarin , who steps down as chief executive next Tuesday at Vodafone 's annual meeting , said the company was "" resilient "" but not "" immune "" to the economic downturn . "" We will ride this one through , "" he said . The news dragged down the shares of other major European telecoms companies , including Telefonica , Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom . Shares in Ericsson , the world 's largest telecoms equipment maker , fell more than 11 per cent after it maintained a sober industry outlook for 2008 at its second quarter results . The market was spooked by Vodafone downgrading its revenue guidance just eight weeks after issuing the forecast with its 2007-08 results . After its first quarter trading update for 2008-09 , Vodafone 's shares closed down 13.6 per cent at 129p . Andy Halford , Vodafone 's chief financial officer , signalled the company would look at the case for a new share buyback . The stock has fallen more than 30 per cent this year .

Vittorio Colao , chief executive , said growth in its operations in India and Turkey had been more than offset by the impact of macroeconomic , regulatory and competitive pressures in Europe . "" We do not see a dramatic change in Europe in the coming quarters , so expect [ further ] headwinds "" , he said , although he reiterated the group 's guidance for the full year . The growth in data usage failed to plug the gap left by declining voice and text revenues , with customers demanding lower-priced phone packages in a fiercely competitive European market . Revenues in southern Europe tumbled by almost a fifth year on year as trading in Vodafone 's business in Spain and Italy showed no signs of improving . Andy Halford , finance director , refused to rule out further writedowns of the group 's southern European businesses , saying that it was not "" easy to call the bottom "" given the "" progressive downward slide "" . The growth in emerging market revenues slowed in the third quarter , which contributed to an overall group service revenue decline of 2.6 per cent , weaker than expected by analysts . This equated to a fall of 0.4 per cent in underlying service revenues excluding mobile termination rate cuts - the fees that telecoms groups charge rivals for handling calls from their networks , which have been forced down by regulation . This was the first time that revenue excluding MTRs declined since the third quarter of 2009 . There was again a stronger performance at Verizon Wireless , where it owns a 45 per cent stake . Verizon Communications , which owns the majority , has expressed interest in acquiring the stake , causing the Vodafone share price to rise in recent weeks . Shares in the group closed up almost 1 per cent at 171.9p Mr Colao said the group regularly reviewed the Verizon Wireless stake but "" for the time being , we are happy with this portfolio allocation "" . Vodafone has pinned its recovery on a strategic shift to the provision of mobile data . Group data revenue rose 12.8 per cent on the back of an increase in European smartphone usage to 33.4 per cent of its customers . "" Data adoption is very strong , "" Mr Colao said .

26-03-2008,869,"Vodafone forecasts Verizon dividend By ANDREW PARKER and PAUL TAYLOR Vodafone has signalled that it expects to start receiving dividends again from Verizon Wireless next year . Verizon Wireless , the second-biggest US mobile operator , emerged last week as the highest bidder in a radio spectrum auction , prompting fresh questions about when the company would resume making dividend payments . The UK mobile phone group has a 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless , with the remainder held by Verizon Communications , the US telecommunications group . Last Thursday regulators announced that Verizon Wireless had agreed to pay Dollars 9.4bn ( Pounds 4.7bn ) for spectrum , which should enhance its mobile broadband services . That sum exceeded some analysts ' expectations and could increase Verizon Wireless ' debt position to an estimated Dollars 17bn to Dollars 20bn . Verizon Wireless last issued dividends in 2005 , when Vodafone received Pounds 923m . The payments dried up after Verizon Communications decided to use Verizon Wireless ' cash flow to pay down the mobile operator 's debt . Verizon Communications has management control of Verizon Wireless and yesterday it declined to spell out a timetable for the resumption of dividend payments . It said : "" The cash distribution policy for 2009 and beyond will be made by the Verizon Wireless board , which will assess a whole range of factors in making its decisions on timing . "" Vodafone signalled that it was sticking by its assertion of last year that the world 's largest mobile group by revenue should receive dividends sometime next year . "" We have not changed our expectations for when dividends will resume , "" it said . Terence Sinclair , analyst at Citi , said : "" We expect dividend payments to resume towards the end of 2009 , but not at the level seen in 2005 . It is 2010 before Verizon Wireless pays about Pounds 1bn or more to Vodafone . "" Vodafone 's minority stake in Verizon Wireless has caused friction between the UK group and some of its investors . Last year ECS , a rebel shareholder , called for the stake to be spun off , but that idea was rejected by most investors at Vodafone 's 2007 annual meeting . Verizon Wireless ' debt stood at about Dollars 10bn before it announced plans last July to buy Rural Cellular , a smaller US mobile operator , in a Dollars 2.7bn deal .

Hutchison is not ruling out similar deals involving its loss-making European mobile businesses , according to people familiar with the company , although they said that no transactions were imminent . Analysts said Hutchison 's UK mobile business was a likely candidate to merge with T-Mobile , which is owned by DeutscheTelekom . Vodafone and Hutchison Whampoa have the third and fourth largest mobile businesses in Australia , and both are sub scale compared to Telstra and SingTel , the market leaders . By merging their Australian operations , the 50:50 joint venture between Vodafone and Hutchison will have a market share of 26 per cent , compared to 32 per cent for SingTel and 42 per cent for Telstra . The combined business will have 6m customers and annual revenue of A$4bn ( US$2.7bn ) , and will use Vodafone 's brand . Vodafone will receive a A$500m payment under the transaction 's terms because its Australian business is bigger than Hutchison's . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , said : "" This transaction will benefit customers in Australia as it creates a company with the necessary scale to compete strongly in the mobile market . "" It is Mr Colao 's first significant transaction since becoming chief executive of Vodafone in July . In November , he said Vodafone would for the first time support "" in-market consolidation "" between mobile operators in particular countries . Such consolidation should ease the price wars between mobile operators , and so enhance profitability . Vodafone blamed a poor performance by its Australian business for a 25 per cent fall in operating profit at its Pacific operations in the six months to September 30 . Hutchison 's group of mobile businesses based on third-generation wireless technology , which include Australia , Italy and the UK , has yet to generate an operating profit . The 3G businesses reported a loss before interest and tax of HK$3.2bn in the first half of 2008 , although that was a 72 per cent improvement on the same period in 2007 . The Australian business reported earnings before interest and tax of A$1.3m in the first half of 2008 . The merger plans have to be approved by competition authorities . The companies said the merger should generate cost savings with a net present value of A$2bn , and analysts at JPMorgan estimated the combined business should see its profit margins improve by 5 percentage points to 22 per cent . The analysts said Hutchison was likely to exit the joint venture in the medium term , adding that the transaction , from the company 's European perspective , may "" signal that they see little future in continuing to go it alone "" .

Arun Sarin , chief executive , said he would "" obviously listen "" if the company received an approach , but insisted he was happy with the new management team under Bill Morrow , the former head of the UK business who was parachuted into the troubled subsidiary three months ago . "" The management team in Japan is doing a very good job and we are on track with the turnround programme , "" Mr Sarin said . He has promised to turn the business around by the end of the current financial year , which runs to March 2006 . Mr Sarin also reiterated his desire to take control of Polkomtel , Poland 's third largest operator , in which Vodafone has a 19.6 per cent stake , but said there had been no progress in talks with the other shareholders , which include the Polish government . The comments came as the company reported subscriber growth figures for the first quarter to the end of June . Vodafone beat market expectations by adding 4.1m net subscribers in the quarter through organic growth , a rise of 35 per cent . It was Vodafone 's strongest quarter for organic growth since 2000 . Analysts had forecast net additions before acquisitions of 3.1m. Mr Sarin said this equated to revenue growth of 8.6 per cent , towards the top end of its guidance given this year , and the group reiterated its guidance for the year . The 6m customers added following two acquisitions in Romania and the Czech Republic take Vodafone 's proportionate customer base ( allowing for its share in joint ventures minority holdings ) to more than 165m . Mr Sarin said growth of its latest 3G handsets was "" building momentum "" with more than 1m registered devices added in the quarter , bringing the group total to 3.3m ( including more than 300,000 data cards ) . The global scale of Vodafone 's business means its figures are closely watched by the industry and investors , amid concerns that operators will struggle to secure a decent return on the tens of billions of dollars spent on rolling out 3G .

Vodafone 's dividend policy was unsustainable without relying on cash from its minority stake in Verizon Wireless , which by next year would provide 62 per cent of group earnings , Nomura said . "" Investors need to start focusing on dividend risk at Vodafone , a new debate for a company seen as a defensive investment in European telecoms , "" said the broker . Tough trading and the recurring cost of spectrum licences meant Vodafone 's current payout commitment equated to 160 per cent of earnings per share from operations it controls , Nomura said . It forecast management to rebase its 2014 dividend to 6p a share , a cut of 41 per cent . Hopes of a bid from joint-venture partner Verizon would "" provide a backstop for Vodafone 's valuation "" , Nomura added . However , it cut Vodafone from its "" buy "" list , sending its shares down 1.5 per cent to a three-month low of 174p .

Sage Group climbed to an 11-year high , up 3.1 per cent to 315.3p , on a retread of speculation that the software maker could be a target for private equity . With cash on the balance sheet , a free cash flow yield from subscription customers of about 7 per cent and a valuation well below US peer Intuit , Sage was a credible target for a leveraged buyout , analysts said . However , they also highlighted that Sage was working to reinvent its sales model for cloud computing , so returns were far from guaranteed .

22-09-2012,877,"Vodafone hits two-month high despite dividend doubts LONDON Vodafone showed its biggest rally in nearly two months as analysts played down fears of a dividend cut . Vodafone 's 7.6 per cent dividend yield is the biggest among London 's blue-chips and accounts for more than 3 per cent of the index total . But with European earnings suffering , the payout is reliant on cash from its minority stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of its net income . As a result , analysts have speculated that Vodafone would cut its ordinary dividend to a level that was covered by cash flow from businesses it controls , then use the US cash to fund bonus payouts . However , Barclays argued for a more palatable option . Vodafone could keep its 10.2p dividend unchanged and use US cash to buy back shares , which would reduce the payout burden over time , Barclays said . Using half the cash from Verizon Wireless for buybacks would cut Vodafone 's annual dividend cost from pound(s)5bn this year to pound(s)4.2bn by 2018 , it calculated . US payments can be relied upon because Verizon , the majority partner , needs cash from the venture just as much as Vodafone , Barclays said . Verizon 's fixed-line business delivers only modest profit and requires significant capital investment , it said . As a result , Barclays raised its target to 200p for Vodafone , which added 2 per cent to 178.5p. The wider market started higher but erased gains in mid-morning after futures and options contracts expired . The FTSE 100 ended down 2.02 points at 5,852.62 , giving it a weekly decline of 1.1 per cent . Xstrata lost 4.2 per cent to pound(s)10.05 following the surprise news that it had been given a one-week extension to respond to Glencore ' s takeover offer . The drop in Xstrata also reflected a FTSE index reweight taking effect overnight , which removed Qatar 's 12 per cent Xstrata stake from its free float calculations and meant tracker funds had to sell around 29m shares to match the revised weighting . Glencore lost 1.7 per cent to 362p . National Grid lost 1.1 per cent to 686.5p after JPMorgan Cazenove turned negative . Looming regulatory rulings and a proposed change for calculating pension liabilities meant Grid 's earnings this year will be at the peak over the next decade , the broker said . Sage , the recent subject of bid and break-up speculation , rose a further 1.7 per cent to 324.8p. Peel Hunt dismissed the talk , citing Sage 's valuation premium against direct rivals in spite of weaker growth prospects . "" We would question the logic of Microsoft ( or anyone else ) paying more than 13 times earnings for a business that has struggled to deliver any meaningful growth in recent years , "" it said .

Exane BNP Paribas upgraded Pearson to "" outperform "" based on an improving outlook for next year for textbook sales . Halfords climbed 3.6 per cent to 268.8p ahead of a trading update due on Thursday , which was expected to show a boost to bike sales following Britain 's success at the Tour de France and Olympics . The sports and hobby category provides more than a quarter of Halfords ' sales . Rentokil Initial rallied 1.9 per cent to 84.5p on renewed talk that it could sell City Link , its lossmaking mail delivery business . "" City Link is seeing operational and volume improvements and , in our opinion , may no longer be a part of the group within six months , "" said RBC Capital Markets after a meeting with Alan Brown , Rentokil 's chief executive . "" Underlying trends leave us of the view that the group can approach break-even in the second half and possibly be profitable in 2013 .

25-07-2009,879,"Vodafone in consolidation call Chief executive sees tie-up advantages ; Focus on savings for mobile operators Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , has made a passionate case for consolidation in the UK mobile phone market , saying that the current arrangements hurt profitability . Although he declined to comment on Vodafone 's interest in buying T-Mobile UK , Mr Colao was "" positive "" about consolidation because it should enable mobile operators to secure cost savings . Analysts said that they regarded Mr Colao 's comments as preparing the ground for Vodafone to launch a bid for T-Mobile , which is valued at EUR3bn-EUR4bn ( pound(s)2.6bn-pound(s)3.5bn ) . Vodafone 's weakness in the UK mobile market was highlighted yesterday in the company 's first-quarter trading update . Although Vodafone 's group revenue performance slightly exceeded expectations , underlying sales in Europe fell 4.4 per cent in the three months to June 30 compared with the same period last year . In the UK , underlying sales fell 4.7 per cent . Mr Colao admitted that Vodafone , the UK 's second-largest operator , was being "" hurt "" by its failure to secure a deal with Apple to sell its iPhone in Britain . O2 , the largest operator owned by Telefonica , has entrenched its position by becoming the exclusive British network for the iPhone . Deutsche Telekom is contemplating selling T-Mobile , its UK subsidiary and the fourth-largest operator , after years of underperformance , and Vodafone and Telefonica are considering making offers . Mr Colao described the UK mobile market as "" inefficient "" and highlighted how the five operators , partly because of fierce competition , had markedly lower profit margins compared with the Continent . UK margins are about 25 per cent , which is 11 percentage points lower than the European average . Mr Colao said that the real benefit of consolidation for operators would be found in reduced operating expenditure rather than higher prices for customers . "" The benefit is much more at the cost level than the revenue level , "" he said . "" It is much more avoiding duplication and optimising the resources in the system . "" Mr Colao addressed potential objections by regulators to how Vodafone or Telefonica , if one of them bought T-Mobile , could secure a 40 per cent market share of revenue paid by British mobile phone users . He highlighted how leading operators in other European countries had market shares of 40 per cent . Vodafone reported group revenue of pound(s)10.7bn for the first quarter , up 9.3 per cent , largely because of sterling 's weakness against the euro . On an underlying basis , group revenue fell 2.1 per cent , partly because customers are spending less in the recession . The group stuck by its previous guidance of generating pound(s)11bn-pound(s)11.8bn of operating profit in 2009-10 , which would at best be a flat performance on 2008-09 .

14-12-2005,881,"Vodafone in Dollars 4.6bn Telsim deal *UK telecommunications group outbids five competitors *Deal ' will dilute earnings for five years ' *Reserve price was Dollars 2.8bn Vodafone won the auction for Turkey 's second largest mobile phone operator yesterday , saying the Dollars 4.55bn ( Pounds 2.57bn ) deal would dilute its earnings for up to five years but raise its longer- term growth profile . The news came a month after a warning on falling profit margins hit shares in the UK group by nearly 11 per cent . Yesterday , they fell another 3 1/2p to 124 3/4p as the price paid for the assets of Telsim took investors and analysts by surprise . Some bankers had warned earlier that any price over Dollars 3bn would be seen as an overpayment . Vodafone 's move into one of the few European telecommunications markets with substantial growth potential came after it beat four Middle Eastern operators - MTC , Etisalat , Orascom and Emaar - and Russia 's Sistema . The UK group made the highest sealed bid and then won the short second-round bidding process in a televised auction . The reserve price had been Dollars 2.8bn. Arun Sarin , Vodafone chief executive , said the Turkish mobile market represented "" a major growth opportunity"".Turkey was Europe 's second most populous country after Germany , he said , and there were just 53 handsets per 100 people , compared with penetration rates of 101 per cent in the UK and85 per cent in Germany . Telsim had revenues of just Dollars 712m in 2004 and earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of Dollars 87m , but Vodafone said the acquisition price would equate to less than five times ebitda within five years . Vodafone , which will also invest more than Dollars 1bn to make up for past under-investment in customer service and Telsim 's network , said the Turkish company would make net losses "" in the short to medium term "" . Analysts in Istanbul said Vodafone 's arrival in the Turkish market would boost competition and pose a challenge for Turkcell , the dominant operator with an estimated two-thirds of the market . The task facing Vodafone is considerable , however , as Turkcell has 25.6m customers , three times as many as Telsim 's 8.2m. Turkcell 's shares fell nearly 7 per cent on the Istanbul stock market , which closed 1.2 per cent lower . Vodafone is acquiring Telsim without its liabilities , and the deal rescues the Turkish operator from a legal limbo . It was among assets acquired by the Turkish government early last year when it seized control of companies owned by the Uzan family , once one of the wealthiest in Turkey . Most of the proceeds of the Telsim sale will go towards settling the Uzan companies ' debts with the state but a substantial portion above the reserve price of Dollars 2.8bn will be paid to Motorola and Nokia , the US and Finnish telecoms equipment makers , to settle debts owed them by the Uzan group .",vodafone in dollars 4.6bn telsim deal *uk telecommunications group outbids five competitors *deal 'w
4-04-2011,883,"Vodafone in EUR8bn SFR sale Vivendi seals 100 % ownership in operator ; UK group to pay debt and buy back shares Vivendi has struck a deal with Vodafone to pay EUR7.95bn ( pound(s)7.02bn ) for the 44 per cent of SFR , France 's second-largest mobile phone company , it does not already own . Jean-Bernard Levy , Vivendi 's chief executive , said the increase in profits that would result from the deal , subject to completion , would allow the group to raise the dividend for shareholders of Europe 's largest publicly listed media company . The deal to secure full ownership of SFR is a long-cherished ambition for Mr Levy . A spokesman for Vivendi said the EUR7.75bn price reflected a valuation of 6.2 times SFR 's 2010 earnings before interest , taxation , depreciation and amortisation . In addition , Vivendi will pay Vodafone EUR200m to reflect the extra cash generation of SFR in the months between January and July this year . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , has been slimming down the company 's portfolio by selling minority stakes in Chinese and Japanese mobile operators . The sale of the SFR stake , if finalised , would be the biggest disposal to date . Mr Colao said the sale was in keeping with Vodafone 's commitment to "" realising maximum value from our noncontrolled assets . The sale of our stake in SFR , at an attractive multiple , represents a significant further step in the execution of this strategy "" . Mr Levy was the only likely buyer for the stake , as his company was the only other shareholder in SFR . The multiple Vivendi has paid is marginally above that typical of European telecoms companies , based on a consensus of analysts . Some of Vodafone 's shareholders were looking for a sale price that implied an enterprise value for SFR of at least six times its ebitda . Vodafone said pound(s)4bn of the deal proceeds would be returned to shareholders via a share buy-back , with the remainder used to pay down debt . Vivendi said the two companies would extend their commercial co-operation for a further three years , including a roaming agreement allowing Vodafone customers to use SFR 's mobile network when they are travelling in France . Mr Levy said : "" We are very pleased to reach our strategic objective to own 100 per cent of SFR . The transaction will create a significant increase in Vivendi 's adjusted net income , enabling us to raise the dividend to our shareholders . "" Mr Levy told a conference last November that he would "" definitely "" walk away from a deal with Vodafone , if he considered the price too high . Mr Colao said at the same conference that he would not be a "" forced seller "" of any asset . The Vodafone chief is also pushing for a resumption of dividend payments by Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake , valued by analysts at pound(s)43.3bn.

8-09-2010,885,"Vodafone in pound(s)4.3bn sell-off Group to offload 3.2 % stake in China Mobile ; Proceeds to fund share buy-back and cut debt Vodafone is selling its 3.2 per cent shareholding in China Mobile for pound(s)4.3bn , in a move that highlights the UK mobile phone group 's determination to dispose of its minority stakes . The company said on Tuesday that 70 per cent of the proceeds from the sale would be returned to shareholders in the form of a share buy-back , with the remainder used to reduce the UK group 's net debt , which stands at pound(s)33.3bn. When it bought its China Mobile stake in two tranches in 2000 and 2002 , Vodafone paid almost $3.3bn ( pound(s)2.1bn ) . Based on China Mobile 's share price on Tuesday , the 3.2 per cent stake was worth almost $6.6bn. Vodafone has agreed to sell its entire stake for pound(s)4.3bn before tax to banks led by Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and UBS . The banks will in turn sell the stake on to institutional investors . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , quelled a potentially large scale investor rebellion at the group 's annual meeting in July by signalling he was looking to sell the company 's minority stakes . The disposal of the China Mobile shareholding was always regarded as the most straightforward because the shares are listed in Hong Kong and New York . Mr Colao highlighted how Vodafone and China Mobile would continue with a strategic alliance formed in 2000 that involves co-operation on mobile phone technology . China Mobile is the world 's largest mobile operator by market capitalisation and subscriber numbers . "" Today 's transaction achieves a near doubling of Vodafone 's original investment in China Mobile and combines our stated portfolio strategy with ongoing co-operation with China 's leading telecommunications company , "" he said . Although Vodafone 's investors will probably welcome the sale of its China Mobile stake , they are most focused on the group 's 45 per cent shareholding in Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator . Vodafone has not received a dividend since 2005 because -Verizon Communications , the US telecoms group which owns the rest of Verizon Wireless , has blocked pay-outs . Mr Colao is pressing for a restoration of dividend payments and is also open to selling the Verizon Wireless stake , which Citi analysts value at pound(s)33bn . However , a sale is difficult given that Verizon Communications is the only plausible buyer . A similar situation exists at SFR , France 's second-largest mobile operator , where Vodafone has a 44 per cent shareholding worth an estimated pound(s)6.8bn. The only likely buyer for Vodafone 's stake is Vivendi , the French media and telecoms group that owns the rest of SFR .

Telecom Egypt , the country 's leading fixed-line phone company , has approached Vodafone about buying the UK group 's 55 per cent stake in Vodafone Egypt . People familiar with the situation said talks about a possible deal began about one month ago , but they stressed no decisions had been taken . Vodafone declined to comment . Telecom Egypt said that it was not aware of the talks . Robin Bienenstock , analyst at Bernstein , said Vodafone could expect to receive about pound(s)3bn for its controlling stake in Vodafone Egypt . Telecom Egypt already owns 45 per cent of Vodafone Egypt , and Tarek Tantawy , the fixed-line phone company 's chief executive , said this month that it was considering how it could enter the domestic mobile market . If a transaction is finalised , it would underline how Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , is willing to slim down the UK mobile group 's large portfolio of assets . Mr Colao said at Vodafone 's annual results on Tuesday that the group was focused on developing its businesses in Europe , sub-Saharan Africa and India . As well as considering the case for disposing of some of Vodafone 's minority stakes in mobile operators , Mr Colao is also willing to contemplate selling some of the UK group 's controlled assets . Mr Colao described Vodafone 's relationship with Telecom Egypt as "" very good "" . The Egyptian mobile market is expected to become more competitive after last month 's settlement between France Telecom and Orascom Telecom , the joint controlling shareholders in ECMS , Egypt 's largest mobile operator . Their decision to end their bitter standoff means that ECMS could become more aggressive . Egypt 's third mobile operator is Etisalat , the Dubai-based telecoms company that paid $2.6bn in 2006 for an Egyptian operating licence . If no deal is finalised with Vodafone , Telecom Egypt could try and secure its own mobile operating licence . The Egyptian government has not ruled out issuing a fourth licence . Vodafone Egypt 's revenue growth has slowed markedly in the past two years because of a combination of the economic slowdown and rising mobile phone ownership in Egypt . Almost 70 per cent of the population owns a mobile . However , Vodafone Egypt is highly profitable , and generated pound(s)488m of operating cash flow in 2009-10 .

26-05-2008,889,"Vodafone joins fight to become leader in mobile phone services Vodafone is likely to do more acquisitions to beef up its internet services for mobile phone customers , according to people familiar with the situation . Though the scale of the initial purchases will probably be small , Arun Sarin , Vodafone chief executive , is hoping to calm fears that the world 's largest mobile operator could lose out in the scramble over the mobile internet . Vodafone this month made its maiden wireless internet deal by agreeing to pay Pounds 25m for Zyb , a Danish social networking company . Its annual results , released tomorrow , will underline how the mobile internet is starting to make a significant contribution to its revenue as the company joins a number of large groups that are fighting it out to establish leading positions in mobile services . At the company 's interim results in November , Vodafone said it had generated Pounds 1bn of revenue from customers using mobiles for data functions such as web surfing . That revenue is largely derived from giving customers access to the wireless internet , but the company is raising its game in mobile services , so as to secure additional sales . Two people familiar with the situation said Vodafone was expected to make more acquisitions in mobile internet services , with similar valuations to Zyb , during the coming year . Zyb enables mobile customers to back up their handsets ' contacts books and photographs online , with the opportunity to share the information with friends . The strategic interest from Vodafone comes as Nokia , the world 's leading mobile phone manufacturer , is investing heavily in building wireless internet services . Last October Nokia announced its largest-ever deal by agreeing to buy Navteq , a US mapping and navigation company , for Dollars 8.1bn ( Pounds 4.1bn ) . Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo , Nokia chief executive , said in December the company should secure "" billions of euros "" from mobile services such as maps and music . Meanwhile , Google , the world 's leading internet search company , is pushing to dominate the selling of advertising on the mobile internet , just as it has done on the fixed-line internet . At an industry conference in February , Mr Sarin insisted Vodafone was well placed to secure a significant share of revenue from mobile internet services by saying fixed-line participants would find it difficult in the "" more complicated "" wireless world . Three days later Vodafone announced it was poaching Pieter Knook , a senior Microsoft executive , to head its newly formed internet services unit . Vodafone 's acquisition activity is not confined to mobile internet services , with the company making bolder moves in fixed-line services . Some analysts say Vodafone is in pole position to buy Tiscali , the Milan-listed company that supplies fixed-line broadband services in the UK and Italy and has a market capitalisation of Euros 1.4bn ( Pounds 1.1bn ) . If Vodafone buys Tiscali , it would have fixed-line broadband operations in all four of its core European markets : Germany , Italy , Spain and the UK . In May 2006 , when Vodafone announced it was moving beyond a mobile-centric strategy to supply customers with fixed-line broadband , Mr Sarin said the company would pursue an "" asset- light "" strategy . That implied that Vodafone would mostly supply fixed-line internet access through wholesale contracts with other telecommunications companies . But last October Vodafone agreed to buy the Italian and Spanish fixed-line broadband units of Tele2 , the Swedish telecoms company , for Euros 775m . Last week Vodafone agreed to pay Euros 474m to buy out minority shareholders at Arcor , its German fixed-line broadband unit . At its annual results for 2007-08 tomorrow , analysts expect Vodafone to report revenue of Pounds 35.2bn to Pounds 35.4bn , adjusted operating profit of Pounds 9.9bn to Pounds 10bn and free cash flow of Pounds 5bn . Vodafone 's shares have fallen almost 20 per cent since November 's interim results , partly because investors fear telecoms companies ' sales will be hit by the global economic downturn . But Vodafone 's shares have also declined because of concerns that regulators will insist on mobile operators making large cuts in the charges they levy on rival companies for connecting calls to their networks . The charges are called mobile termination rates , and Morgan Stanley analysts , who have a "" sell "" rating on Vodafone , estimate they represent 20 per cent of the company 's European free cash flow .",vodafone joins fight to become leader in mobile phone services
22-12-2006,891,"Vodafone keeps eye on India for growth Investors are worried about costs , write Andrew Parker , Kate Burgess and Jo Johnson Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , knows India well . He was born and grew up there , and graduated in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur . During the 1990s he was president of AirTouch Communications , the US mobile operator that subsequently merged with Vodafone . In 1995 he unveiled AirTouch 's purchase of a minority stake in RPG , one of India 's mobile operators , which Vodafone later sold . In 2005 , Vodafone bought a 10 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel , India 's leading mobile operator . Last month Mr Sarin reiterated Vodafone 's ambitions to increase its stake in Bharti Airtel , given India has the fastest growing mobile market in the world . He also appeared to insist that it was possible for Vodafone to eventually secure control of Bharti Airtel . "" India is a large country . We have taken an interest in the number one player , which is growing very rapidly . . . over the next several years we might find interesting ways in joining hands and increasing our share , "" he said . However , Sunil Bharti Mittal , chairman of Bharti Enterprises and founder of Bharti Airtel , is reluctant to let Vodafone increase its stake , let alone take control . Vodafone 's board last night gave the go-ahead for an offer to be made for Hutchison Essar , India 's fourth largest mobile phone operator . Vodafone is eyeing deals in emerging markets bec-ause it is keen to boost the group 's slowing revenue growth and declining profit margins . At its interim results in November , Sir John Bond , Vodafone 's chairman , app-eared to put his support behind such deals . He highlighted how emerging markets were expected to make up 70 per cent of the growth in mobile handset sales over the next five to 10 years . Bankers say Sir John is unhappy that Vodafone may have boxed itself into a minority stake in Bharti Airtel and is looking for change . Hutchison Telecommunications International 's app-arent willingness to sellits 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar , albeit at the right price , provides Vodafone with an attractive opportunity because the four major players in India 's mobile market are fairly evenly matched . Bharti Airtel has a 22 per cent share of subscribers , Reliance Communications 21 per cent , BSNL 19 per cent and Hutchison Essar 17 per cent . The risks for Vodafone are considerable . It could antagonise its investors if it pays a high price for Hutchison Essar . Some of Vodafone 's investors became angry after the group warned in November of slowing revenue growth . Their concerns were intensified by Vodafone 's deals , notably in Turkey . Some investors thought the group overpaid for Telsim , Turkey 's second largest mobile operator , which was bought for Dollars 4.6bn. Vodafone could end up paying a steep price for growth . At an enterprise value of Dollars 14bn , Vodafone would be paying 14 times Hutchison Essar 's forecast 2007 earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ( ebitda ) . That compares to trading multiples of 11 times 2007 ebitda for Bharti Airtel and Reliance . Vodafone is trading on between five and six times . Vodafone could find itself in a bidding war with Reliance , which has been talking to private equity firms about making a Dollars 14bn offer . The company would be keen to avoid a repeat of its ill-fated attempt to buy AT&T Wireless in 2004 . It made a Dollars 38bn offer , but was trumped at the last minute by Cingular . Lord MacLaurin , Vodafone 's former chairman , admitted after the failed bid that it had damaged the group 's relations with investors . The group 's shares fell in the immediate aftermath . But Vodafone 's inv-estors reacted cautiously but positively to a possible offer for Hutchison Essar . "" This is an on-strategy acquisition , "" one shareholder said . Another shareholder said Vodafone 's acquisition rec-ord was not covered in glory , but added that investors would give the group the benefit of the doubt on Hutchison Essar . The shareholder said relations with the group remained fragile . "" The price paid is key . There is a degree of rehabilitation but if Arun Sarin is seen doing something egregious , the goodwill would dissipate fast . "" Investors have been partly won over by Vodafone 's improving stock price over the past four months . They have also been reassured by Sir John 's appointment as chairman . As former chairman of HSBC , the international bank with a leading position in Asia , he won a reputation as a tough businessman who made shrewd acquisitions in emerging markets .","vodafone keeps eye on india for growth investors are worried about costs, write andrew parker, kate"

14-11-2007,895,"Vodafone lifts guidance and dividend By ANDREW EDGECLIFFE-JOHNSON and ANDREW PARKER Vodafone yesterday underlined its confidence by raising its guidance on operating profit for 2007-08 , as it claimed that revenue from people using mobile phones for web surfing was finally starting to take off . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , hailed how Vodafone had seen a 45 per cent increase in revenue from mobile data functions such as downloading music . Such growth is bolstering Vodafone 's top line in its core European markets , where it is engaged in fierce competition with rival mobile operators . Mr Sarin also said the revenue situation in Europe could improve next year because of fewer punitive interventions by regulators compared with 2007-08 . Vodafone yesterday reported half-year results that came in ahead of the market 's expectations . Shares in the world 's largest mobile group by revenue closed up 13.7p at 195.7p. Mr Sarin said the results vindicated the group 's approach . "" Our strategy remains right and relevant in the current environment , "" he added . Revenue for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 17bn , up 4.4 per cent on an underlying basis compared with the same period last year , and adjusted operating profit was Pounds 5.2bn , up 6.1 per cent . Vodafone recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6bn , compared with a loss of Pounds 3.3bn in the first half of 2006-07 . That improvement was principally because Vodafone wrote down the value of some of its European businesses last year . The group raised its guidance on adjusted operating profit for 2007-08 from between Pounds 9.3bn and Pounds 9.8bn to between Pounds 9.5bn and Pounds 9.9bn. Mr Sarin highlighted how Vodafone Essar , the Indian mobile business bought for Pounds 5.5bn in May , was delivering revenue growth of 53 per cent and signing up 1.6m new customers each month . Vodafone 's businesses in emerging markets currently contribute about 25 per cent of the group 's revenue , but recorded growth of 16 per cent on an underlying basis in the first half . In Europe , where 75 per cent of revenue is generated , revenue growth was 2 per cent , reflecting how Vodafone is cutting prices to stay competitive . Vodafone was also hit by the European Union law that forced mobile operators to cut the charges they impose on people for using their mobiles while abroad . However , Mr Sarin highlighted how interventions by regulators had been offset by growth in people using their mobiles for data functions such as web surfing . Data revenue was Pounds 965m in the first half , up 45 per cent on an underlying basis . Mr Sarin confirmed that Vodafone was interested in securing control of Vodacom , South Africa 's largest mobile operator . Vodafone has a 50 per cent stake in Vodacom . Telkom , the South African telecommunications company that owns the remaining 50 per cent , is considering whether to sell . Vodafone announced an interim dividend of 2.49p , up 6 per cent . Earnings per share were 6.22p ( loss per share of 8.02p ) . Lex , Page 18 www.ft.com / ukdailyview",vodafone lifts guidance and dividend

Its shares were one of only three blue-chip fallers in London as analysts cut numbers . Credit Suisse , Nomura and Exane BNP Paribas all trimmed earnings forecasts by about 3 per cent to reflect competition in Europe . Profit warnings from KPN and Belgacom have pointed to smartphones cannibalising voice usage , suggesting consensus expectations for Vodafone 's margins still need to fall , Nomura said . It cut forecasts to "" pre-empt cautious margin guidance "" at full-year results next Tuesday .

Vodafone ended weaker by 0.3 per cent to 169 1/2 p even as all three brokers kept "" buy "" advice . "" We do not see results as a great positive catalyst but believe that consensus is now sufficiently cautious , "" said BNP .

A better than expected US performance lifted InterContinental Hotels by 3.9 per cent to pound(s)12.98 while Imperial Tobacco gained 3.1 per cent to pound(s)22.24 after boosting investor returns .

Reed Elsevier climbed 3.3 per cent to 549 1/2 p after it hosted a seminar on its risk information unit , the publisher 's first investor day for four years . The meeting "" marked a significant turning point in the company 's communication strategy "" , said Credit Suisse . Sage Group rose 3.6 per cent to 296p on talk that the accounting software maker was a takeover target for Oracle or SAP . Dealers doubted the talk and noted that Sage management was on a US investor roadshow this week . But they added that the disposal of Sage 's perennially underperforming US healthcare unit looked more plausible . Misys , which has also been the subject of rumours about a bid or the disposal of a division , added a further 1.4 per cent to 348 1/4 p. Fiserv and SunGard Data Systems would be potential bidders , though they might need more evidence that Misys 's banking unit had been turned round , said analysts . Premier Foods led the mid-cap gainers , up 6.4 per cent to 38 3/4 p , after Citigroup turned positive with a 40p price target . A debt restructuring last October cleaned up the company structure but left investors nonplussed , it said , and added : "" We believe that as performance stabilises , the market will be increasingly willing to ascribe a ' sensible ' valuation to the stock .

TalkTalk , the UK internet provider , lost 2.5 per cent to 134 3/4 p after it cut package prices , a move analysts said was likely to have been in response to competition from BT 's Plusnet brand . Set-top box maker Pace slumped 39.2 per cent to 93p on a warning that it had paid too much to stock up on inventory this year . Analysts said that , while there was no confidence left in management or forecasts , the distressed valuation might make Pace a takeover target for a rival .

24-05-2006,901,"Vodafone misses the rally because of trepidation about its results LONDON Vodafone Group failed to join yesterday 's powerful rally that saw the FTSE 100 register its biggest one-day points gain since March 2003 and in the process recoup all and more of Monday 's losses . After heavy trading , shares in the mobile phone operator closed 1 per cent cheaper at 116 3/4p on fears that next week 's results could disappoint . Amid the boardroom wrangles and speculation about the future of Verizon Wireless , its US joint venture , the City seems to have lost track of the fact that trading at Vodafone has been tough . The mobile phone company has been forced to reduce earnings forecasts twice since November and analysts are worried that guidance will be cut again when full-year results are announced next Tuesday along with an eagerly-awaited strategic review . "" Part of Vodafone 's guidance is to outperform its competitors and currently this is not being done in key markets . To stabilise market share loss , Vodafone may need to sacrifice margin , "" said Merrill Lynch after reducing its 2006-07 earnings per share forecast by 4-5 per cent . Traders said that yesterday 's poor performance from Vodafone also reflected comments made by Doreen Toben , the chief financial officer of Verizon Communications , who told delegates at a Morgan Stanley conference that she did not anticipate any deal with Vodafone in the near future . In the wider market , volatility continued to be the name of the game . Confused City traders were left scratching their heads as the FTSE 100 bounced back from Monday 's five-month low to close 146 points , or 2,64 per cent , higher at 5,678.7 - its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 2003 . Elsewhere , the FTSE 250 , which suffered its biggest one-day points fall ever on Monday , surged 405.7 points , or 4.6 per cent to 9,234.3 - its biggest one-day points gain on record . In spite of the rally , the mood in the City remains nervous . "" I do n't think anyone believes we are out of the woods yet or that this was anything more than a dead cat bounce , "" commented one trader . Yesterday 's trading proved to be a reversal of Monday 's session . Mining and oil stocks , which investors almost could not give away 24 hours earlier , were suddenly back in demand as the price of copper cleared the Dollars 8,000 a tonne level again and oil crude futures broke through Dollars 70 a barrel . Kazakhmys , one of Monday 's biggest fallers , rose13 per cent to Pounds 10.82 1/2 , while Xstrata gained 10 per cent to Pounds 19.42 and Antofagasta added 9.7 per cent to finish at Pounds 20.72.

Property stocks were also on the move after British Land , up 6.4 per cent to Pounds 12.38 , announced a 32 per cent rise in net asset value and pledged to convert toa tax-efficient investment trust status as soon aspossible . Hammerson rose 7 per cent to Pounds 11.23 , Liberty International gained 7 per cent to Pounds 10.42 and Land Securities moved up 5.6 per cent to Pounds 17.80 as Alec Pelmore , Merrill Lynch 's top-rated property analyst , upgraded . "" Having seen a 10 per cent fall in shares prices in the past two weeks , we are upgrading all of the UK majors to buy .

Vittorio Colao yesterday reassured investors that the revenue decline at Vodafone 's European businesses was slowing . He also said Vodafone 's board was unanimous that shareholder value was best secured through the group 's current structure . Mr Colao has been facing growing investor disquiet over Vodafone 's underperforming European businesses , as well as the company 's inability to secure a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator in which Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake . Some shareholders say he risks receiving calls to break up the group given that Vodafone 's shares trade at a 30-40 per cent discount to some analysts ' valuations of the sum of its parts . Vodafone yesterday said that while its European businesses continued to report falling underlying sales , they were collectively edging closer to growth . European revenue fell 3.2 per cent in the three months to December 31 compared with the same period in 2008 . It fell by 4.6 per cent in the second quarter . Group revenue rose 10.3 per cent to pound(s)11.5bn in the third quarter compared with the same time in 2008 , driven by favourable exchange rate movements and acquisitions . The group raised its 2009-10 free cash flow guidance - broadly defined as earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation minus capital spending - from pound(s)6bn-pound(s)6.5bn to pound(s)6.5bn-pound(s)7bn. The improvement reflects better cost and working capital management . "" These results represent a good step forward since we first felt the effect of the recession in mid-2008 , "" said Mr Colao , who declined to say when Vodafone 's European businesses would return to growth . He highlighted the benefits of scale , including purchasing power when buying mobiles and other equipment , the ability to secure revenue when customers use their handsets while abroad , and the opportunity to supply telecoms services to multinational companies . "" The board regularly reviews our corporate structure and there is unanimous opinion that the current structure serves well the value of shareholders , "" Mr Colao said . He also noted good performances at some of Vodafone 's emerging market businesses . Turkey , which has been reporting falling sales since mid-2008 , returned to growth in the third quarter .

"" The classical resolution would be for the more highly-rated company to buy out the weaker . "" Investors have long called for Vodafone and Verizon to merge , or for Vodafone to sell its 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless . But the valuation discrepancy means a merger of equals would be unattractive to Vodafone shareholders , while the tax implications complicated any stake sale , Morgan Stanley said .

17-04-2008,909,"Vodafone ponders Tiscali bid as deadline looms By ADRIAN MICHAELS and PHILIP STAFFORD Vodafone is considering joining the bidding for Tiscali as the Italian telecoms group set a deadline of May 5 for initial non-binding offers . A number of companies are expected to review a bid for the Cagliari-based group , which could be attractive to larger companies that want to increase their share in the Italian and UK fixed-line broadband markets . A person familiar with the situation said Vodafone was considering bidding for both the whole group or just its UK assets . Vodafone already has interests in Italy , having agreed last October to buy the Italian broadband business owned by Tele2 , the country 's fifth-largest internet access provider . Vodafone said it would not comment on speculation . Tiscali has previously indicated that it would prefer not to break itself up . However , analysts have cautioned that few companies would be keen to acquire the whole group given the little overlap between its UK and Italian assets . The May 5 deadline was only indicative , the people close to the company said , and Tiscali was not in a hurry to make a sale . In the UK , BT Group , British Sky Broadcasting and Carphone Warehouse are considering bidding for the UK division , which has a 15 per cent market share and is expected to generate 69 per cent of Tiscali 's group revenue in 2008 and 76 per cent of its earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation . Investment bankers studying the situation said that Italy 's Wind would also take a look at Tiscali 's Italian division , which has only a 6 per cent market share . Telecom Italia and Fastweb are also interested in Tiscali . However , advisers to some of the interested companies cautioned yesterday that Tiscali 's market capitalisation of about Euros 1.2bn ( Dollars 1.9bn ) implied that bids needed to be higher than would be reached under industry average subscriber acquisition costs . A buyer would , therefore , need to find substantial synergies , they said .

6-11-2010,911,"Vodafone prepares for smart move MOBILE & TELECOMS ; News analysis ; Smartphones and sell-offs will head the group 's strategic review , writes Andrew Parker Vodafone will next Tuesday unveil the outcome of an eagerly-awaited strategic review of the mobile phone operator . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , is expected to give a strong signal that he will sell more of the group 's minority stakes in overseas mobile operators He is also due to provide investors with Vodafone 's answer to the biggest question hanging over all mobile operators : how to secure long-term revenue growth from the surging consumer demand for smartphones . Mr Colao is enjoying better relations with shareholders than at the start of the year , when some were questioning his strategy . Investors are happier with Mr Colao in part because of the prospect of a dividend from Verizon Wireless , the US mobile operator that Vodafone has a 45 per cent stake in . Verizon Communications , the controlling shareholder in Verizon Wireless , has been blocking pay-outs since 2005 , in an apparent attempt to squeeze Vodafone out , but said in June that dividends might restart in 2012 . Then in September Vodafone announced the sale of its 3 per cent stake in China Mobile for pound(s)4.3bn and said 70 per cent of the proceeds would be returned to investors . In the coming months , Vodafone could sell its 44 per cent stake in SFR , the French mobile operator . UBS analysts say Vodafone 's stake could fetch pound(s)7bn . Investors are now increasingly focused on whether Mr Colao can restore significant revenue growth to Vodafone 's core European operations , which generate almost 70 per cent of the group 's sales . The European businesses have been reporting falling voice revenues from basic phone services for years - because of competitive and regulatory pressures - and the economic downturn put further pressure on the operations . However , the rate of European revenue decline has been slowing over the past year , and this improving sales trend is partly due to rising customer take-up of smartphones such as Apple 's iPhone . Customers using smartphones are estimated by Bernstein analysts to pay 25 per cent more each month to their mobile operator than those with basic mobiles . Vodafone is therefore getting a revenue fillip as its customers increasingly switch to smartphones , but the challenge is whether this one-off boost can be turned into long term growth . At the iPhone 's launch in 2007 , operators chose to provide smartphone customers with "" all-you-can-eat "" tariffs which meant they paid a fixed amount each month . The idea was to reassure customers they would not face large bills if they did a lot of web surfing . But the infrastructure is now creaking under the increased data demands of customers watching videos on mobile phones . Networks including those of Telefonica 's O2 UK have struggled to cope with bandwidth-hungry smartphone customers . Vodafone is now betting on customers starting to value the operators with networks capable of powering smartphones . Unlike some rivals , Vodafone has continued to invest in its infrastructure during the downturn . Anyone wanting to enjoy the full benefits of Vodafone 's networks will probably have to pay a premium , however . It is introducing a sophisticated new charging model for smartphones based on the amount of data consumed by customers and the quality of service they require . Vodafone will sell a premium service to customers who want to download data at a fast speed at any time of day . Customers can pay less if they accept slower download speeds during peak daytime periods . "" Offering attractively priced data services to a long tail of future smartphone users offers a substantial opportunity for future growth , offsetting revenue declines from traditional services , "" says Robert Grindle , analyst at Deutsche Bank . The success - or failure - of Vodafone 's initiative will almost certainly hinge on how competitors respond . There are signs that Vodafone 's large European rivals are planning similar data pricing models , but much rests on whether smaller players , such as Hutchison Whampoa 's 3 UK , opt for a price war .

9-11-2009,913,"Vodafone prepares fresh round of cost cutting as revenues fall Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , is preparing a fresh round of cost cutting as he tries to offset falling revenue at the mobile phone operator . Vodafone 's shares have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 16 per cent this year , partly because of concern at how the UK company 's underlying revenue at most of its core European businesses is falling .

Vodafone has a target of cutting its operating expenses by pound(s)1bn by March 2011 , but analysts at Citi , the UK company 's broker , said the goal might be increased to pound(s)1.5bn. The Citi analysts are expecting Vodafone to report pound(s)21.6bn of revenue for the six months to September 30 , up 8.3 per cent on the same period last year , and pound(s)7.5bn of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation , up 2.8 per cent . The performance is due to be flattered by acquisitions and sterling 's weakness against other currencies . Some of Vodafone 's main European businesses , such as those in the UK and Spain , are expected to report declining revenue , because consumers are spending less on their mobile phones during the recession . The results are also likely to show how some of Vodafone 's most important assets in emerging markets are under pressure . Vodafone secured control of Vodacom , South Africa 's largest mobile operator , in May , but last month it announced an impairment charge of $400m that is expected to dent the UK company 's earnings . Analysts at Bernstein say one possible piece of good news is the potential for an earlier than expected resumption of dividend payments by Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator . Vodafone owns 45 per cent of Verizon Wireless , while Verizon Communications , the US telecoms company , holds the remainder . Verizon Wireless stopped issuing dividends in 2005 , after Verizon Communications decided to use Verizon Wireless 's cash flow to pay down the mobile operator 's debt . When Verizon Wireless last year agreed to buy Alltel , a smaller rival , Vodafone said it did not expect a resumption of dividend payments until 2012 . But Bernstein analysts say payments could start in 2011 , because Verizon Communications needs Verizon Wireless 's cash to pay its own dividends .

14-11-2007,915,"Vodafone raises profit guidance By ANDREW EDGECLIFFE-JOHNSON and ANDREW PARKER Vodafone yesterday underlined its confidence by raising its guidance on operating profit for 2007-08 , as it claimed that revenue from people using mobile phones for web surfing was finally starting to take off . Arun Sarin , chief executive , hailed how the UK group had seen a 45 per cent increase in revenue from mobile data functions such as downloading music . Such growth is bolstering Vodafone 's top line in its core European markets . Mr Sarin also said the revenue situation in Europe could improve next year because of fewer punitive interventions by regulators compared with 2007-08 . Vodafone yesterday reported half-year results that came in ahead of market expectations . Shares in the world 's largest mobile group by revenue closed up 13.7p at 195.7p. Revenue for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 17bn ( Dollars 35bn ) , up 4.4 per cent on an underlying basis compared with the same period last year , and adjusted operating profit of Pounds 5.2bn , up 6.1 per cent . Vodafone recorded a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6bn , compared with a loss of Pounds 3.3bn in the first half of 2006-07 . That improvement was principally because Vodafone wrote down the value of some European businesses last year . The group raised its guidance on adjusted operating profit for 2007-08 from between Pounds 9.3bn and Pounds 9.8bn to between Pounds 9.5bn and Pounds 9.9bn. Mr Sarin highlighted how Vodafone Essar , the Indian mobile business bought for Pounds 5.5bn in May , was delivering revenue growth of 53 per cent , and signing up 1.6m new customers each month . Vodafone 's businesses in emerging markets currently contribute about 25 per cent of the group 's revenue , but recorded growth of 16 per cent on an underlying basis in the first half . In Europe , revenue growth was 2 per cent .",vodafone raises profit guidance

17-09-2009,919,"Vodafone reassures on merger of rivals mobile & telecoms Vodafone tried to reassure investors yesterday that it would benefit from plans for a merger between the UK mobile phone businesses of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom . Once the market leader in the UK , Vodafone faces becoming the third largest British mobile operator if the merger between France Telecom 's Orange UK and Deutsche Telekom 's T-Mobile UK is approved by competition authorities . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , told a New York conference that the company 's British business would still be a "" big number three "" if the merger was finalised . "" It 's probably going to be a better market , "" he said . Analysts say consolidation should give all the remaining UK mobile operators greater pricing power , and therefore higher profit margins . Vodafone is the second largest UK network operator , behind Telefonica 's O2 subsidiary . Orange UK and T-Mobile UK are the third and fourth largest operators , but would become the market leader after the proposed merger . The fifth operator is 3 , owned by Hutchison Whampoa . The margins of UK operators are about 10 percentage points lower than their counterparts in continental Europe due to fierce competition . Mr Colao highlighted the Netherlands , where the number of network operators reduced from four to three in 2007 when Deutsche Telekom bought France Telecom 's Dutch business . KPN and Vodafone compete with Deutsche Telekom in the Netherlands , and Cazenove analysts said the profit margins of all three remaining operators had improved after consolidation . Mr Colao said : "" We were not consolidators in the Netherlands but we have benefited from consolidation . "" Mr Colao used the conference to underline Vodafone 's ambitions to secure revenue from the increasing popularity of mobile phones that provide access to the internet . Mr Colao highlighted how Vodafone will enable customers to use their handsets to buy content off the wireless internet , such as newspapers , and have the cost included on their mobile phone bill . Such arrangements could prove popular because they avoid the need to pay by credit card , with the associated risk of online fraud . Credit : By Andrew Parker",vodafone reassures on merger of rivals

Vodafone 's annual report , published on Wednesday , said managers ' bonuses would take greater account of profit-based targets by reducing the relative importance of revenue-based targets . The report also disclosed that Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , would only receive 30.6 per cent of the performance shares he was potentially entitled to under a long-term incentive plan . Vodafone is changing top managers ' remuneration as it seeks to halt the decline in its profit margin at the level of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation . In 2010-11 , the ebitda margin fell by 1.1 percentage points to 32 per cent . Last year , Vodafone made taking revenue market share from rivals a key part of top managers ' cash bonuses , as the group tried to end weak performances by some of its European businesses . Vodafone 's remuneration committee decided that 30 per cent of bonuses in 2010-11 would be based on revenue growth , with 20 per cent tied to increasing operating profit . The rest of the bonuses were based on free cash flow and a comparison with rivals ' performances . In May , Mr Colao claimed Vodafone was increasing or maintaining its revenue market share in most key countries . Fourth-quarter results for 2010-11 showed solid revenue performances at Vodafone 's UK and German businesses . Vodafone 's remuneration committee has decided that in 2011-12 , 25 per cent of bonuses will be based on increasing ebitda , with 25 per cent tied to revenue growth . "" To emphasise our focus on profitable growth we have rebalanced the weightings for . . . revenue and profit so the two measures are equally weighted , "" said the annual report . Mr Colao 's basic pay and perks , including his bonus , increased by 2.5 per cent to pound(s)2.7m in 2010-11 . At pound(s)1.3m , however , his bonus fell short of the maximum potential pay-out of pound(s)2m . In addition to his basic pay and perks , Mr Colao will see 2.1m performance shares vest in July under the group 's long term incentive plan . Mr Colao was awarded 7.1m shares under the scheme in 2008 , but only 2.1m will vest based on Vodafone 's operational performance over the three years to 2010-11 . The 2.1m shares represent 30.6 per cent of his maximum entitlement , and are worth pound(s)3.5m based on Wednesday 's closing price of 161.55p. At March 31 , Mr Colao had been awarded 20.6m shares under the long-term incentive plan , worth pound(s)36.3m. However , the shares are all subject to performance conditions . Mr Colao 's salary will increase by 6.4 per cent to pound(s)1.1m in 2011-12 .

That followed AT&T this week rearranging its mobile and consumer wire line businesses into a single division . The move could force Verizon , co-owner of Vodafone 's US wireless joint venture , to follow suit , MF Global analysts said . "" In the past , we think Verizon felt the need to pay a full price for Vodafone 's stake , "" said the broker . "" AT&T is making Verizon feel the need now . "" Traders were cautious on the theory . While a sale would allow Vodafone 's new chief executive Vittorio Colao to return about 50p per share to investors , it would also risk putting the company in play further down the line , they said . A Morgan Stanley note also helped underpin Vodafone shares . The broker kept a 170p target price , citing market research suggesting there had been no significant change in spending in the company 's key European markets .

26-10-2006,925,"Vodafone revamps with Musiwave deal MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS Vodafone is revamping its web portal for music and video downloads as part of ongoing efforts by the mobile phone operator to increase revenues generated from its third-generationnetwork . Vodafone 's UK business has hired Musiwave , a mobile content management company , to improve the search facilities on Vodafone live , its entertainment portal . The deal , due to be announced today , could increase Vodafone 's comparatively small revenue from data transmission . 3 , the mobile phone operator that launched the UK 's first 3G network in 2003 , yesterday claimed success in getting customers to pay for music , games and mobile TV . In its latest set of accounts filed at Companies House , for the 2004 financial year , 3 UK reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.5bn. Mobile phone operators spent billions of pounds on 3G licences in the hopethat such higher speed networks would help growth , particularly by allowing consumers to make use of data services such as music and video downloads . But sales of 3G mobile phones have been disappointing and data revenues represent a small proportion of turnover compared with revenues from voice transmission . Text messaging has so far been the dominant component of data services . Vodafone launched its 3G network in 2004 . In its efforts to lift sales of 3G phones , it is releasing lower priced handsets for Christmas . The deal with Musiwave is designed to ensure that customers get a better experience on the Vodafone live portal . Vodafone hopes that the enhanced search facilities will make it easier for customers to make multiple purchases by their favourite bands . They will also offer customers the chance to buy ringtones and video downloads by the same bands . Al Russell , head of content services at Vodafone UK , said the partnership with Musiwave was significant . "" Keeping the mobile content purchasing experience relatively simple and user- friendly is also key to ensure that users complete purchases and are satisfied . "" People familiar with 3UK , which is owned by Hutchison Whampoa , said it expected revenues of Pounds 100m from data services excluding text messaging in 2006 . In August , 3 said it had 3.75m UK customers and reported revenues of Pounds 700m for the first six months of 2006 . Yesterday , 3 claimed that its portal was the second- most popular destination for downloads of UK chart singles after Apple 's iTunes , albeit by some distance . It said it had a 10 per cent share of singles sales in the second quarter of 2006 . Bob Fuller , 3 UK chief executive , said revenues from non-text data services would be equal to the total turnover of Bloomsbury , publisher of Harry Potter , in 2006 .",vodafone revamps with musiwave deal mobile telecommunications
24-07-2008,927,"Vodafone reveals plan for pound(s)1bn share buy-back MOBILE & TELECOMS Vodafone has taken the unusual step of revealing a pound(s)1bn share buy-back in immediate response to the record sell-off of its stock after Tuesday 's revenue warning . The world 's largest mobile phone operator by revenue was hit by the largest one- day decline in its shares on Tuesday . The stock fell almost 14 per cent after Vodafone said the economic downturn was hurting its Spanish and UK businesses . Announcing the pound(s)1bn share buy-back yesterday , the company said : "" This action reflects the board 's belief that the share price significantly undervalues Vodafone . "" Vodafone 's shares rose 1.9 per cent to 131.4p. Graham Secker , equity strategist at Morgan Stanley , said Vodafone 's share buyback , while unusual , may be well timed . Research undertaken by Mr Secker last year found that buy-backs , while having little or no impact in a bull market , did support share prices in a bear scenario . The fall in Vodafone 's shares was driven partly by heightened fears that telecoms stocks are no longer safe havens in a downturn . Vodafone scaled back its revenue forecast for 2008-09 at its first-quarter trading update , partly because some people were delaying upgrades of mobile phones . But before Tuesday 's sell-off , Vodafone 's shares had already fallen 20 per cent this year , in line with the telecoms sector . The fall is partly due to a statement in January from AT&T , the largest US telecoms company , which said that it was having to cut off customers who were failing to pay bills amid deteriorating economic conditions . Mr Secker noted that the UK mobile industry had never been tested in a recession , given that the previous one was in the early 1990s , when the wireless phone sector was in its infancy . Vodafone 's new buy-back will be financed through existing banking facilities . On March 31 , Vodafone had net debt of pound(s)25.2bn. Standard & Poor 's , the ratings agency , said Vodafone 's ratings were unchanged by the buy-back , but added : "" A weakening of operating performance . . . or any future revision of guidance for 2009 , could put pressure on the ratings and outlook .

29-05-2006,933,"Vodafone seeks organic growth as acquisitions drive unwinds Vodafone , the mobile phone group , is set to signal tomorrow that it plans to improve revenue growth by extracting better performance from existing assets rather than embarking on another acquisition spree . While announcing annual results that may show a record pre-tax loss , Vodafone is expected to reassure investors that it is not looking to revive slowing revenue growth by buying more mobile operators in emerging markets . Instead , Vodafone is seeking to improve the performance of existing assets by cutting costs and developing strategies to increase customers ' use of mobiles . Vodafone was built into the world 's biggest mobile phone operator by revenue by a series of large deals such as the Pounds 101bn acquisition of Germany 's Mannesman in 2000 . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive since 2003 , last year pursued the acquisition culture of his predecessor by buying mobile operators in the Czech Republic , Romania and Turkey . But people close to Vodafone said the pace of deals would slow and that future activity was likely to be focused on increasing shareholdings in companies in which it already has minority stakes . "" Expectations on acquisitions are more modest , "" said one person close to the company . For example , Vodafone last year bought a 10 per cent stake in Bharti , India 's biggest mobile operator , and would be interested in increasing it . Vodafone had already rattled investors in November by warning that revenue growthwould be lower in 2007 than in 2006 . It cut its 2007 growth forecast again in February . Tomorrow , Vodafone will outline plans to increase customers ' use of mobiles in its core European markets by offering lower tariffs inside homes . Mr Sarin is also expected to promise better performance by cutting costs . Vodafone is consideringoutsourcing some of its information technology functionsand organising supply-chain management at group level rather than in its operatingcompanies . Vodafone 's annual results for 2006 may show it reporting a bigger pre-tax loss than the Pounds 13.5bn recorded in 2002 because of a write-down in the value of its assets . The goodwill write-down of up to Pounds 28bn , announced in February , relates primarily to the acquisition of Mannesman .",vodafone seeks organic growth as acquisitions drive unwinds
17-09-2010,935,"Vodafone seeks to bolster empire via strategic sales Mobile & telecoms ; News analysis ; Group takes tough stance following bout of investor pressure , writes Andrew Parker Vodafone 's chief executive is starting to shrink his sprawling empire . Vittorio Colao this month supervised the sale of Vodafone 's 3.2 per cent stake in China Mobile for pound(s)4.3bn , and said most of the proceeds would be returned to investors in the form of a share buy-back . The disposal is unlikely to be the last . Shortly after the China Mobile sale , Mr Colao announced a reorganisation of the Vodafone group under which he took personal charge of its minority stakes in four mobile phone operators . All four stakes are potentially up for sale , which will please investors who have been pushing for disposals of these shareholdings . But in a video interview with the Financial Times , Mr Colao stresses he will not be forced into selling any minority stakes following an embarrassing investor rebellion at Vodafone 's annual meeting in July . "" I will never put myself and my company in the position of a forced seller , "" says Mr Colao . One of the key reasons for his uncompromising stance is that Vodafone 's two most valuable minority stakes are not expected to attract a lot of bidders . Verizon Communications , the US telecoms group , is the only plausible buyer for Vodafone 's 45 per cent stake in Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator . Verizon Communications owns the remainder of Verizon Wireless and has repeatedly stated it would like to buy out Vodafone . Vivendi , the French media and telecoms group , is the only likely buyer of Vodafone 's 44 per cent stake in SFR , France 's second-largest mobile operator . Vivendi owns the rest of SFR and wishes to be sole shareholder . Citi analysts value Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless stake at pound(s)32.8bn , and the SFR holding at pound(s)6.8bn , and Mr Colao does not want his difficult negotiating position with Verizon Communications and Vivendi to be hampered by investor -pressure . The US situation is complex . Verizon Communications has blocked dividend payments by Verizon Wireless since 2005 , in a move widely seen as an attempt to squeeze Vodafone out . Verizon Communications has insisted the cash generated by Verizon Wireless be used to reduce its debt . However , Verizon Wireless ' debt should be paid off next year , which could enable a restoration of dividend payments in 2012 . Verizon Communications could , if it wished , pre-empt the dividend issue by trying to buy Vodafone out . But any sale of Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless stake is complicated by the fact that the UK group has been advised the transaction could attract a large capital gains tax bill . One way to avoid this tax liability would be for Vodafone and Verizon Communications to merge . Although Mr Colao suggests a merger is not the most likely outcome of Vodafone 's Verizon Wireless deliberations , he refuses to rule it out . Meanwhile , selling Vodafone 's smaller minority stakes may also not be straightforward . Vodafone has a 4.4 per cent interest in Bharti Airtel , India 's largest mobile operator , through a 26 per cent stake in Bharti Infotel , a holding company . The only likely buyer for Vodafone 's stake , worth pound(s)200m , is Bharti . Finally , Vodafone has a 24.4 per cent stake in Polkomtel , the Polish mobile operator , worth pound(s)900m . But any disposal process could be protracted because Polkomtel 's other shareholders are four state-controlled Polish companies . While some investors may take umbrage at Mr Colao 's statement that they should wait patiently for Vodafone to dispose of some or all of its minority stakes , shareholders will be encouraged by Vodafone 's willingness to also sell assets it controls . Mr Colao wants to develop Vodafone 's businesses in Europe , subSaharan Africa and India . Although he does not identify potential disposals , his geographic focus means Vodafone could , for example , sell its controlling stake in Vodafone Egypt , the country 's second-largest operator , worth pound(s)1.8bn. The UK group could also sell its New Zealand business , worth pound(s)1.2bn , and a 50 per cent stake in Vodafone Australia , the country 's third- largest operator , worth pound(s)800m . Some of Vodafone 's investors have grown increasingly angry at its acquisitions record given Bernstein analysts estimate the group has over the past decade written down the value of its assets by pound(s)51bn . The latest came in May , when Vodafone took a pound(s)2.3bn impairment charge on its Indian business , the country 's second-largest mobile operator . Mr Colao admits some of the deals done by his predecessors were "" pricey "" but he does not see those transactions as precluding him from buying assets . Although he is cautious on acquisitions and does not name any potential targets Vodafone is interested in the possibility of buying smaller Indian mobile operators if the New Delhi government relaxes rules that prohibit consolidation . So while Mr Colao may be shrinking the Vodafone empire , he is also looking at how to strengthen the remaining parts . Credit : By Andrew Parker",vodafone seeks to bolster empire via strategic sales

This is because of fierce competitive pressures in countries hard hit by worsening economic conditions . The telecoms group 's service revenues might have fallen 0.7 per cent in the second quarter against a year ago , with declines expected of about 12 per cent in southern European countries such as Spain and Italy . The UK is expected to have suffered a moderate decline in service revenues , although countered by an increase of about 3 per cent in Germany . This should bolster the northern European segment growth to about 1.6 per cent , highlighting a disparity with the south . The strongest performance is expected from Turkey , where revenues might be as much as a fifth higher , and from its stake in the US , where Verizon Wireless has reported service revenue growth of 7.5 per cent . First-half margins are expected to be slightly lower at about 31 per cent , with falling European margins likely to be offset by expansion in South Africa and India . Consensus first-half earnings are put at pound(s)6.8bn , a 10 per cent decline but mostly owing to foreign exchange movements . Stripping out this , analysts expect group ebitda to be down about 2.5 per cent in the first half . Photo : Bloomberg Credit : By Daniel Thomas",vodafone set for service revenue dip
10-09-2009,941,"Vodafone set to slip down the rankings in its home market mobile & telecoms ; News analysis ; The likely shake-up in the UK causes discomfort for world 's biggest mobile group , says Andrew Parker The likely consolidation of the British mobile phone industry is causing much discomfort for Vodafone in its home market . Vodafone 's UK business was the market leader as recently as 2006 , but it has been overtaken by O2 , the mobile operator owned by Spain 's Telefonica . If the competition authorities approve plans for a merger between France Telecom 's Orange UK and Deutsche Telekom 's TMobile UK , the new entity would become the market leader , with O2 in second place . Vodafone - the world 's largest mobile operator by revenue because of its mobile businesses scattered across the globe - would become the number three in its home market . Ben Wood , analyst at CCS Insight , said Vodafone would be the biggest loser from a merger between Orange UK and T-Mobile UK , which are the third and fourth-largest mobile operators respectively . "" Having once dominated the UK market , Vodafone finds itself in third position , "" he said . "" With its global headquarters based in the UK , this will be a bitter pill to swallow . "" Analysts identified two deal-making possibilities for Vodafone following Tuesday 's announcement that France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are proposing to put their UK mobile assets into a joint venture . First , Vodafone could gatecrash the merger plans by making a higher offer for T-Mobile UK . Vodafone and Telefonica made informal offers of about pound(s)4bn for T-Mobile UK last month , but they were deemed too low by Deutsche Telekom . Second , Vodafone could buy 3 , the UK 's fifth mobile operator , which is owned by Hong Kong 's Hutchison Whampoa . 3 is markedly smaller than the "" big four "" UK mobile operators , and has a 9 per cent share of revenue paid by British mobile phone users . It has yet to record a pre-tax profit . Vodafone yesterday played down the prospect of doing deals in the UK . "" Our UK business is and will continue to be a very strong participant in its market and our focus is on returning to organic growth , "" it said . Guy Laurence , head of Vodafone 's UK business , told staff in an e-mail on Tuesday that the likely price sought by Deutsche Telekom for T-Mobile UK "" made it preferable to continue with our current structure "" . He suggested Vodafone had an opportunity because Orange UK and T-Mobile UK would be distracted by the merger plans . Mr Laurence also implied Vodafone , once the UK market leader , must adopt an underdog mentality to halt its falling sales and earnings . "" I 've always said that we need to approach the UK market with a challenger spirit - so we will continue to execute our strategy with speed , simplicity and trust to outperform our competitors , "" he said . Meanwhile , analysts said O2 's chances of retaining its status as the exclusive UK network for Apple 's popular iPhone have been diminished by the merger plans involving Orange UK and T-Mobile UK . Apple could decide its interests are best served by letting Orange UK and T-Mobile UK sell the iPhone . Assuming France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom finalise their merger plans , much time will then be devoted to lobbying the competition authorities . The regulators will subject the merger to intense scrutiny , given the concern that mobile consolidation could result in higher prices for consumers . The French and German companies are expected to argue that the pound(s)3.5bn ( $5.8bn ) of cost savings sought in the merger should enable higher investment in networks that will support web surfing and other data activities on mobile phones and laptops . The argument should get a sympathetic hearing with the UK government , because its Digital Britain initiative is partly focused on providing broadband internet access to all homes by 2012 .",vodafone set to slip down the rankings in its home market
24-05-2007,943,"Vodafone sets a strong tone on talk of AT&T interest By NEIL HUME and ROBERT ORR Turnover in Vodafone topped 1.3bn shares yesterday as traders piled in amid rumours of predatory interest from a US rival . Shares in the mobile phone operator closed 3.7 per cent higher at 149.9p - the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 - on rumours that it could be a takeover target for AT&T . Sector watchers said the Dollars 250bn US telecoms company was the only industry player big enough to buy Vodafone and the only one that would not run into regulatory problems . AT&T recently tried to break into Europe when it joined forces with America Movil of Mexico to try and buy a large stake in Telecom Italia . However , others were sceptical . They said the timing of the rumour looked odd as AT&T 's chief executive , Ed Whitacre , steps down next month . Dealers reckoned the rise had been exacerbated by short sellers buying back positions . Just over 6 per cent of Vodafone 's issued share capital is currently on loan . Based on average daily trading volumes , that would take a week and half to buy back . Dealers also pointed out that there had been no nasty shocks in the telecoms reporting season and this was a good sign as Vodafone publishes annual results on Tuesday . Vodafone 's strong performance , which was mirrored in shares of telecoms stocks across Europe , helped the FTSE 100 close 9.8 points , or 0.2 per cent , higher at 6,616.4. Elsewhere , the FTSE 250 added 43.9 points , or 0.4 per cent , to close at 12,220.2. Vodafone was not the only telecoms group on the move . BT rose 2.8 per cent to 326 1/2p while Cable & Wireless gained 2.7 per cent to 186.7p amid talk today 's full year results would impress , with the company meeting forecasts and providing strong guidance for 2008 , particularly in the UK . Pennon Group , the owner of South West Water , remained in the speculative spotlight . Its shares climbed 5.2 per cent to 691p amid talk that it could be a takeover target for Aguas de Barcelona , the Spanish utility company controlled by Suez and La Caxia . Traders said there was some logic behind the rumour as Aguas owns Bristol Water . However , they cautioned that any offer was unlikely to be made before Pennon files half-year results next Thursday . In the same sector , Kelda , which owns Yorkshire Water , added 3 per cent to Pounds 10.01 1/2p amid talk that it too could be a takeover target . The tittle tattle in the market yesterday was that Kelda is being stalked by a foreign financial buyer . On a less speculative tack , Rexam , the world 's biggest maker of drinks cans , added 2.9 per cent to 535p as short sellers closed positions after ABN Amro upgraded to "" buy "" . The Dutch broker said Rexam was trading on an undemanding price / earnings multiple . Elsewhere , Hammerson added 1.3 per cent to Pounds 16 on talk it could be a takeover target for British Land , up 2.1 per cent to Pounds 14.56 , while Compass Group improved 1.1 per cent to 381 3/4p after Citigroup reiterated its "" buy "" recommendation . The broker said shares in the contract caterer could reach 500p if it were able to improve its capital expenditure / sales ratio . BHP Billiton firmed 0.6 per cent to Pounds 12.13 amid suggestions that it might make a ' White Knight ' bid for Alcan , the Canadian metals company currently fighting a hostile bid from US rival Alcoa . On the downside , Bradford & Bingley dipped 1.8 per cent to 447p after ABN Amro warned that a trading update , due on June 21 , could disappoint and result in earnings downgrades . The broker said B&B shares could fall to 400p . Sugar producer Tate & Lyle dropped 6.2 per cent to 605p after warning of modest profits growth from its zero calorie sweetener Splenda .

31-03-2007,945,"Vodafone shares drop on news of UK profits fall Vodafone 's shares fell more than 4 per cent yesterday after the mobile phone group revealed how the profitability of its UK business had been hurt by a dash for top-line growth . Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , tried to calm investor nerves at the end of an all-day presentation to analysts by stressing the UK was the group 's most competitive market and he did not foresee the same challenges elsewhere . The shares dipped 5.5 per cent in mid-afternoon trading after the disclosure that the UK margin on earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation had declined from 34 per cent in the six months to March 31 last year to 26.6 per cent in the five months to February 28 this year . The shares closed down4.3 per cent at 135.5p. It was the largest fall since November 2005 . Mr Sarin sought to allay investor concern by drawing attention to Vodafone 's guidance last May that the group 's ebitda margin would fall by one percentage point in 2006-07 compared with 2005-06 . "" We continue to believe here in Europe that we will see dilution of margin gradually , "" said Mr Sarin . "" Equally , we do not see a freefall in margin . "" Vodafone 's UK business has sacrificed its ebitda margin during the last nine months and instead focused on revenue growth . Vodafone was forced to change its strategy because 0 , Orange and T-Mobile had been cutting the prices of their mobile packages . Cuts in Vodafone 's tariffs have bolstered revenue growth , partly by attracting new customers . Service revenue growth increased 5 per cent in January and February compared with the same period last year . But analysts expressed concern about the ebitda margin . "" The UK margins are weaker than expected and , while revenue growth is stronger , we doubt it will be able to sustain this higher growth rate for long , "" said Martin Mabbutt , analyst at Nomura , who has a "" buy "" rating on the stock .",vodafone shares drop on news of uk profits fall
1-04-2008,947,"Vodafone shares hit by watchdog alert Vodafone 's shares fell almost 4 per cent yesterday as investors reacted to claims that regulators are preparing to take action that would cut the UK mobile group 's European core earnings by 11 per cent . Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded their recommendation on Vodafone 's shares from "" buy "" to "" sell "" after concluding that intervention by the European Commission could reduce core profits at Vodafone 's European mobile businesses by Pounds 900m ( Dollars 1.78bn ) between 2009 and 2012 . Meanwhile , Vodafone also had a further setback in its efforts to secure control of Vodacom , South Africa 's leading mobile operator . Telkom , South Africa 's fixed line phone company , signalled it would not consider selling its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to Vodafone "" without a compelling strategic rationale "" . Vodafone owns the remainder of Vodacom . Nick Delfas , analyst at Morgan Stanley , published a research note predicting that Viviane Reding , European commissioner for telecoms , could take action that would cut Vodafone 's earnings . Vodafone 's shares closed down 3.89 per cent at 150.9p. Mr Delfas highlighted Ms Reding 's interest in the case for reducing termination rates . These are charges that mobile and fixed line phone operators impose on each other when connecting calls to their networks . Mobile operators secure significant revenue from fixed line companies from termination rates because regulators currently allow the European wireless phone groups to charge almost nine times more on average than their wired rivals for connecting calls . Mr Delfas said Ms Reding , together with national telecoms regulators , could insist on mobile termination rates coming down from an average of 9.67 euro cents per minute in 2007 to 2.5 euro cents by 2012 . He estimated progressive cuts between 2009 and 2012 would reduce Vodafone 's European earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation by 11 per cent , or Pounds 900m . That would equate to a 8 per cent cut in the group 's ebitda . He also warned of a further threat by predicting that cuts in termination rates could unleash a price war . Mr Delfas said the combined impact of cuts in rates and the price war could reduce a typical large mobile operator 's European cash flow by 39 per cent between 2009 and 2012 . He accused analysts and investors of ignoring Ms Reding 's interest in termination rates , adding some had made the same mistake prior to her law that last year forced cuts in the cost of making mobile phone calls while abroad . Ms Reding claims termination rates are de facto subsidies for the European mobile industry , and wants the charges to reflect the true costs of connecting calls to networks . Terence Sinclair , analyst at Citi , disputed Morgan Stanley 's analysis , saying concerns were "" misplaced "" . He estimated a 20 per cent fall in mobile termination rates would reduce Vodafone 's group earnings per share by less than 2 per cent .",vodafone shares hit by watchdog alert
4-04-2013,949,"Vodafone sheds gain after bid talk denied US telecoms group Verizon denied it was considering a bid for Vodafone , halting a rally across Europe 's telecom sector . Speculation that Verizon and AT&T were uniting to make a break-up bid for Vodafone had prompted investors to buy into the UK group 's shares , as well as some of Europe 's largest telecom groups . However , yesterday Vodafone fell 3 per cent to 186p , reversing the gains as investors sold out of the stock . A note from analysts at UBS added downward pressure on the sector .

10-11-2010,951,"Vodafone steps up non-core asset sales with pound(s)3bn Softbank disposal Vodafone has accelerated its efforts to dispose of peripheral assets by selling its interests in Softbank , the Japanese mobile phone operator , for pound(s)3.1bn ( $5bn ) . Vodafone officials also talked up the prospect that it would once again receive dividends from Verizon Wireless , the leading US mobile operator in which it has a 45 per cent stake . Verizon Communications , Verizon Wireless 's controlling shareholder , has been blocking dividends since 2005 , but Vodafone said it was likely that payments would resume in 2012 . A Verizon Wireless dividend could increase Vodafone 's free cash flow by 50 per cent . Vodafone 's interim results surpassed analysts ' expectations , and were accompanied by an agreement to sell its interests in Softbank 's mobile subsidiary . Vodafone sold its Japanese mobile business to Softbank in 2006 for pound(s)6.8bn in cash . As part of the deal , Softbank issued Vodafone with preferred shares in its Japanese mobile subsidiary . Vodafone also issued a loan to Softbank . Vodafone will use an initial payment of pound(s)1.6bn by Softbank next month to reduce the UK group 's net debt . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , predicted for the first time that the group could achieve annual revenue growth of up to 4 per cent over the next three years .

5-04-2011,953,"Vodafone strategy in focus after SFR move MOBILE & TELECOMS ; News analysis ; There is speculation on the course the slimmed-down group will take in the US and India , says Simon Mundy When Vittorio Colao rep-laced Arun Sarin as chief executive of Vodafone in 2008 , he found himself under pressure from activist shareholders keen for a break from the expansionist strategy of his predecessor . Vodafone 's EUR8bn ( $11.4bn ) sale to Vivendi of a 44 per cent stake in the French mobile phone business SFR , announced on Monday , is the biggest in a series of disposals of minority holdings . The disposal will cheer those investors who wanted a slimmed-down Vodafone with a greater focus on its controlled operations . But it will heighten speculation about Vodafone 's course , with particular scrutiny of its strategy in India and the US . Analysts broadly agreed that Vodafone secured a good price for its stake in SFR , given that Vivendi - which owned the remaining shares in the group - had been reported to be unwilling to pay more than pound(s)6bn ( $9.7bn ) . Vodafone said the agreed price valued SFR at 6.7 times last year 's earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation - a 24 per cent premium to the sector , according to Citi . "" I think they 're exiting at a pretty decent multiple , ahead of a potential period of disruption in the French market , "" says James Britton of Nomura . He points to the entry to the mobile phone market next year of Iliad , an internet provider , and a UK auction of fourth-generation spectrum licences this summer . The SFR deal will allow Vodafone to pay down debt , which , according to Merrill Lynch , will give the company "" a huge credit tailwind in a sector starved of credit improvement stories "" . It follows the disposals of a pound(s)3.1bn stake in Japan 's Softbank and a pound(s)4.3bn holding in China Mobile , providing net proceeds of pound(s)11.1bn when a pound(s)3.1bn investment in India 's Vodafone Essar is taken into account . This will allow pound(s)7bn to be returned to shareholders , says Merrill , and pound(s)4bn to be spent on paying down debt . Yet the biggest of Vodafone 's minority stakes remains : a 45 per cent holding in Verizon Wireless , the mobile arm of US telecoms group Verizon Communications , which owns the remaining shares . Verizon Wireless has not paid a dividend since 2005 , after its parent insisted that cash generated be used to pay down debt . Analysts viewed Verizon Communications ' stance as an attempt to force Vodafone out . Few expect Vodafone to abandon the US . "" The big elephant trades are done with , "" as Merrill Lynch puts it . The capital gains tax on the proceeds of a sale of Verizon Wireless would be prohibitive . Instead , the investment is expected to start returning cash to Vodafone next year . Cash pressures on its fellow shareholder , and strong earnings at Verizon Wireless , are likely to force a change of heart on dividend policy . Verizon Wireless was beginning to generate so much cash , "" you ca n't spend it all "" , Ivan Seidenberg , Verizon Communications ' chief executive , said in December . Despite the drive to shed minority stakes , analysts say it would be mistaken to portray Vodafone as scaling back its horizons . Some predict a move for Verizon Wireless 's 23 per cent holding in Vodafone Italy , which would give Vodafone full control of the group and boost the chances of a dividend from Verizon . Vodafone has a presence in Africa through operations in Egypt and Ghanaand a 65 per cent stake in South Africa 's Vodacom , which has more than 40m customers . Last month it paid pound(s)3.1bn to buy out a minority 33 per cent stake in Vodafone Essar in India . Vodafone has faced a rocky ride since moving into India four years ago . With 15 operators , the country 's mobile sector is far more competitive than Vodafone 's European markets and the company faces a battle with Indian authorities over $2.5bn that the latter says is due on its 2007 Indian acquisition . But while those problems have been well publicised , "" investors have n't yet cottoned on to how good the underlying market has become "" , says Mr Britton . He says Vodafone has added to its market share in India , with prices beginning to stabilise .

16-11-2005,957,"Vodafone suffers a congestion charge Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , felt "" slightly congested "" while presenting interim results yesterday . The 11 per cent , or Pounds 9bn , drop in the company 's market capitalisation should clear the head better than a lifetime of lozenges . Results were good , the outlook less so . Japan faces further "" significant "" margin pressure next year and could make an operating loss . A rapid recovery is unlikely . NTT DoCoMo , with sales four times larger , expects only a 10 per cent return on capital this year . It spends 37 per cent of sales on customer retention and acquisition , compared with 28 per cent for Vodafone Japan . At least Japan has disappointed its way to irrelevance - it now contributes just4 per cent of Vodafone 's operating income . In Europe , Vodafone expects a modest dip in margins and intensifying competition in Germany and Italy . Finally , Vodafone expects Pounds 5bn of one-off tax payments . Taking a step back , it is genuinely surprising that the market is so upset . A Pounds 9bn tax provision sits on the balance sheet - a fair clue that historically low cash tax payments might reverse . Admittedly earnings forecasts for next year should fallby 5-8 per cent . But this says more about the City 's failure to "" kitchen sink "" its Japan estimates than a new industrial reality . Vodafone could have increased its cash payout from the current 100 per cent of free cash flow . Still , it has big , legitimate acquisition opportunities .

15-11-2006,959,"Vodafone THE Arun Sarin was widely predicted to walk the plank , but Vodafone 's chief executive is the last man standing . Of the chairman , deputy and executive directors serving in March 2005 , six of the seven will have left by December . Strategic decisions made during this period have proved astute . A fifth of the then market capitalisation , or Pounds 21bn , has been returned to shareholders . Vodafone Japan was sold for an excellent price , given its subsequent woes under Softbank . And Vodafone resisted hysterical calls to sell its Verizon wireless stake , the value of which has soared . First half results showed some revival at the operating level . The tax rate will now be in the low , rather than mid thirties , boosting earnings by about 5 per cent . The value of this roughly offsets the Pounds 5bn tax hit that so incensed investors last November . Adjusting for an accounting change , organic proportionate mobile sales growth was at the top end of guidance of 6-6.5 per cent . Margins were stable . Execution has improved . The big picture has not . Just over half of earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation came from ex-growth Europe where price elasticity remains poor . Still , this is now priced in . Few eyebrows were raised at the Pounds 4.3bn impairment charge in Germany , nor at the footnote explaining that this assumed 5 per cent annual ebitda declines until 2011 . The remaining ebitda is split between the US , growing at 21 per cent , and mainly emerging markets growing at 12 per cent . Vodafone will hold an investor day to highlight the latter on December 6 . Mr Sarin was keen to point out that the Pounds 2.6bn acquisition of Turkey 's Telsim is outperforming its budget . Chairman Sir John Bond used his first public outing to highlight growth beyond Europe . It may not be original or even well-timed , but along with improved execution , this new sense of direction should mark the close of Vodafone 's annus horribilis .",vodafone the
20-09-2005,961,"Vodafone THE It is a long way from 2000 . At its annual strategy meeting yesterday , Vodafone enthused about text messaging among the over- 45s .

Customers upgrading to Vodafone 's 3G "" Live "" portal show a 16 per cent ARPU uplift . Vodafone has a modest lead in products and network capability . Across western Europe it takes about 20 per cent of net customer additions , but 40 per cent of net new 3G adds . The snag is that at its rate of 1.1m proportionate 3G additions each quarter , it would take 35 years to penetrate the existing user base . This conservatism reflects experience in Japan , Hong Kong and Portugal . There , incumbents ' margins have been hit by up to 5 percentage points by 3G handset subsidies and the cost from running two technologies . Organic sales growth is an impressive 9 per cent , helped by emerging markets . But in Vodafone 's big European markets , growth now tracks nominal gross domestic product . Regulatory price cuts and competitor relaunches , for example in Germany , can make these mature units quite volatile too , although Vodafone 's sheer size helps to dilute any upsets . Vodafone 's strategy and balance sheet management hover between the two poles of growth stock and utility . Until the company itself feels more comfortable with its next product cycle , it seems likely its rating will hover there too .",vodafone the

17-11-2004,965,"Vodafone to double dividend and increase share buyback Vodafone yesterday said it would double its dividend and further increase its share buyback programme in a firm sign that the mobile operator has listened to shareholder demands to raise its cash payouts . The increases will take its dividend payouts for the financial year to Pounds 2.8bn , giving it a healthy yield - based on yesterday 's share price close - of almost 3 per cent . The company also raised its share buyback programme from Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn . Vodafone reported a 6 per cent rise in underlying group turnover to Pounds 16.8bn for the six months to the end of September as it continued to add users to its global customer base . The growth , slightly ahead of consensus expectations , was driven by 7.4m new customers in the first half , taking its global base to 146.7m. However , some analysts pointed to evidence of a slowdown in revenue growth in key markets such as Italy , a trend they attributed to increasing competition from new entrants such as 3 . After strong early gains , shares in Vodafone closed down 3/4p at 142p . The bigger-than-expected dividend increase underlines the company 's continued ability to deliver strong free cash flow . For the first six months , free cash flow in the group was Pounds 4.3bn , a7 per cent decline on the same period last year after the sale of Japan Telecom , the fixed-line operator . Over the period , the company delivered a pre-tax profit on ordinary activities before exceptionals of Pounds 5.4bn. Group earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation were 6 per cent higher at Pounds 8.3bn. Arun Sarin , chief executive , said the higher payouts to investors would still give Vodafone freedom to pursue acquisition opportunities and maintain its coveted single A credit rating . He said he would not be surprised if Vodafone made an acquisition in eastern Europe and he still expected to gain control of SFR , the French mobile arm that is majority owned by Vivendi Universal , the French media group . In an encouraging sign of likely future uptake of new services , the company revealed revenues from non-text data , such as video and music downloads , accounted for between 3 and 4 per cent of total group revenues .

Vittorio Colao , chief executive , blamed weakness in southern European markets for revenues for the year to March 31 falling to pound(s)44.4bn , down 4.2 per cent - or pound(s)2bn - from the previous year . "" We have faced headwinds from a combination of continued tough economic conditions , particularly in southern Europe , and an adverse European regulatory environment , "" he said . Vodafone has been one of the biggest victims of Europe 's lacklustre mobile markets , which have come under intense competitive and regulatory pressure . It blamed regulatory cuts to mobile termination rates - wholesale charges to rival providers for connecting calls - as well as the continued decline in voice revenues . Andy Halford , chief financial officer , said the effect of mobile termination rate cuts had been more severe in the past quarter . "" The macroeconomic environment is what is hurting us most , especially in southern Europe . "" Conditions in that region were so dismal that Vodafone was forced to book a pound(s)7.7bn impairment relating to its businesses in Italy and Spain , where service revenues contracted 12.8 per cent and 11.5 per cent , respectively . "" The reason for it is largely the economic environment . It is an exercise that we have to do each half year , "" said Mr Halford . Mr Colao declined to confirm speculation Vodafone was poised to sell its 45 per cent stake in Verizon . "" Verizon Wireless is a fantastic asset that generates a lot of cash . If we have to update the market , then we will . "" Verizon has been increasingly vocal this year about its desire to buy out Vodafone from the joint venture , a stake that Goldman Sachs analysts have valued at $115bn post-tax . Vodafone said that the pound(s)2.1bn Verizon dividend was "" to be retained in the business for general business purposes , including spectrum costs "" - a move that quashes speculation of a new share buyback scheme after the current programme expires in July . For the 12 months to March 31 , Vodafone reported that pre-tax profit slipped from pound(s)9.6bn to pound(s)3.3bn. Excluding the impact of exceptional charges , adjusted operating profit rose 9.3 per cent year on year to pound(s)12bn . Diluted earnings per share contracted from 13.65p to 0.87p , and a final dividend of 6.92p was proposed compared with 6.47p last year , bringing the total payout for the year to 10.19p , up 7 per cent .

Vodafone , which employs 4,300 people in Spain , declined to say how many jobs were at risk at its operations in the country , where revenues fell 11 per cent in the six months to September last year . The decision to reduce jobs follows the announcement in 2011 by Telefonica , Spain 's former telecoms monopoly , that it would cut 6,500 domestic positions by the end of this year . The big telecoms groups in Spain , where Vodafone is the second-largest operator by clients , have suffered because of a price war with lower-cost rivals such as Jazztel at a time when a quarter of Spaniards are unemployed . In November , Vodafone was forced to write down pound(s)5.9bn from the value of its businesses in Spain , Italy and Greece , dragging the operator to a first-half pre-tax loss of pound(s)492m - down from an pound(s)8bn profit in the year before .

The shares slid 1.4 per cent to 149 1/2 p after Verizon 's chief executive Ivan Seidenberg said a merger did not "" seem to have a lot of appeal "" . Last week Vodafone had added 3.4 per cent on news that it was in discussions over the future of its Verizon Wireless venture , which does not currently pay a dividend . Mr Seidenberg told reporters that , while Verizon would like to find a way to "" resolve "" Vodafone 's minority stake in the venture , a union was not on the agenda .

Arun Sarin , Vodafone 's chief executive , is under pressure from investors after warning last November of declining profit margins in 2006 and reduced revenue growth and lower free cash flow in 2007 . Mr Sarin is expected to set out plans to increase Vodafone 's revenue growth by getting more customers to drop their fixed-line telephones in favour of mobiles . A survey of 17 analysts by Reuters published last week found average underlying earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation of Pounds 11.64bn for Vodafone 's 2006 fiscal year compared to Pounds 10.74bn in 2005 . But Vodafone will report massive post-exceptional pre-tax losses following its decision in February to take a goodwill write-down on its historic investments of up to Pounds 28bn , a record for a British company . The survey found underlying revenues of Pounds 29.28bn compared to Pounds 26.68bn in 2005 .

16-06-2005,977,"Vodafone underlines impact Vodafone was one of the first blue-chip companies to report the impact of international accounting standards and reveal one of the most substantial increases in net debt . Restating its books for September last year , the mobile phone operator said that net debt of Pounds 8.7bn under UK accounting standards would rise by 27 per cent to Pounds 11.1bn under international accounting rules . The increase was overlooked due to attention being focused on an end to goodwill amortisation that boosted Vodafone 's profit . However , the higher debt levels did reflect accounting issues that many companies were facing - although Vodafone said the changes were largely cosmetic . "" What we 've got are presentational differences in our debt rather than a fundamental increase in net debt , "" said an investor relations official . More than Pounds 1bn of the rise was accounted for by new rules on "" proportionate consolidation "" , which required the group to account for its 77 per cent stake in an Italian joint venture . Previously , the joint venture had appeared in the accounts as if it was 100 per cent owned but the new treatment meant Vodafone stopped recognising assets that effectively belonged to its partner , pushing net debt higher . A further Pounds 880m rise in debt came from the reclassification of preference shares , which are branded as debt under IFRS . The IAS 39 standard on financial instruments accounted for another Pounds 350m as the requirement to display liabilities at "" fair value "" captured a set of refinancing bonds . Vodafone took great care to ensure investors were not unnerved by the changes . "" People had been aware of the preference share issue for a while but proportionate consolidation was a new concept for some , so it took a little more time to go through the mechanics , "" said the official .",vodafone underlines impact

Vodafone 's shares closed at 151.25p , up 2p . Several investors were positive about the deal , which gives Hutchison Essar an equity value of Dollars 17.5bn , partly because Mr Sarin said it met Vodafone 's financial criteria on acquisitions . Vodafone said it would realise Dollars 1bn of savings through a network-sharing agreement with Bharti Airtel , India 's largest mobile operator . After deducting debt attributable to certain holding companies , Vodafone has agreed to pay Dollars 11.1bn in cash to HTIL , which is a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa , the Hong Kong-based conglomerate .

14-02-2013,983,"Vodafone weighs bid for German cable group UK operator considers making move for KDG ; Signs of consolidation in European sector Vodafone , the UK telecoms operator , has discussed a bid for Kabel Deutschland , Germany 's largest cable operator , amid signs that consolidation in Europe 's fragmented cable sector is gaining momentum . Vodafone 's senior management has been weighing up a potential bid for the German group , two people with knowledge of the situation told the Financial Times , although they stressed that the UK company had made no decision and had not approached KDG . The revelation comes only days after Liberty Global further bolstered its role in the European cable market with the acquisition of Virgin Media in the UK . The US group cut its teeth as a European consolidator in Germany in 2011 , when it bought Kabel BW and merged it with Unity Media , which it already owned . Given its strong position in Germany , a Vodafone bid could see Liberty also take a look at KDG , although there might be regulatory concerns . Deutsche Telekom , the German group , could also prove protective of its home market . Vodafone has been linked with various European groups over the past year after comments by management that it could look to become partners with or buy into cable operators across Europe to gain access to their fibre networks . The company had a first , brief look at KDG as far back as early 2010 . The UK group is the only big telecoms operator in Europe not to have an incumbent fixedline network , although it does own fibreoptic lines in some countries . The lack of a full network could put Vodafone at a disadvantage when competing against companies already bundling mobile services with TV and broadband . One person with knowledge of the situation said there could be contact between Vodafone and KDG this week - although both companies declined to comment on any aspect of the reports . Vodafone shares closed 2.1 per cent down at 169.92p. KDG finished the day 8.6 per cent higher at EUR69.37 a share , giving the group a market capitalisation of EUR5.6bn. At the end of its last quarter , KDG had net debt of EUR2.8bn , giving it an enterprise value of EUR8.4bn. More content and the bundling of TV , phone and internet have allowed KDG and Unity Media Kabel BW to persuade their customers to subscribe to more services . KDG had 13.9m subscriptions last year , compared with its rival 's 10.9m. Both reported strong sales growth and quarterly revenues of about EUR450m . Vittorio Colao , Vodafone chief executive , told the FT last week that the company was continuing to look at the cable market in Europe . He said the group would either strike commercial agreements with cable operators , invest in its own fibre networks , as it had done in Portugal and elsewhere , or "" look at existing assets "" to acquire .

5-07-2008,985,"Vodafone wins pound(s)2bn tax battle The world 's biggest mobile phone group has won a billion-pound battle with Revenue & Customs over the tax on one of its foreign subsidiaries . The High Court yesterday ordered Revenue & Customs to close a long-running inquiry into Vodafone 's 2001 tax return after ruling that it would be unlawful to apply UK rates of corporation tax to a subsidiary based in Luxembourg . Vodafone , which set up the unit as part of its 1999 acquisition of Germany 's Mannesmann , had estimated the cost of losing the case at more than pound(s)2bn . The judgment is a setback for the Treasury in its confrontation with multinationals over their ability to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions . Its desire to tighten anti-avoidance rules has prompted threats by several large companies to move their tax domicile overseas . Bill Dodwell of Deloitte said that , while he expected the financial impact of the case on the Treasury to be limited , the decision was embarrassing . "" It is un-doubtedly a setback . "" The ruling is also likely to strengthen the incentive for the Treasury to sweep away its "" controlled foreign company "" legislation , which imposes tax on subsidiaries in low tax countries . It has already proposed replacing the CFC rules , in an effort to shore up its defences against avoidance if it goes ahead with plans to allow the tax-free repatriation of foreign profits . Revenue & Customs said it would appeal : "" The government will continue to defend its ability to enforce the CFC rules , which are designed to counter tax avoidance through artificial shifting of profits to offshore subsidiaries . "" Vodafone 's victory will come as a relief to other multinationals facing disputes with Revenue & Customs over anti-avoidance rules . Advisers said a number of UK-based multinationals have financing structures in European Union countries , notably the Netherlands , Ireland and Luxembourg , which have been challenged by Revenue & Customs on the grounds they did not comply with the CFC rules . Revenue & Customs is now bogged down in arguments with multinationals over the stringency of its proposed alternative , which would bring passive income - such as royalties and intellectual property - into the tax net . The Treasury is considering issuing an update on its thinking later this month , but a full consultation paper has been postponed pending further discussions with business . Yesterday 's ruling , over Vodafone 's tax returns for the year to March 2001 , concerned legislation which has since been amended . But Mark Persoff of Clifford Chance , the legal firm , said the judgment cast doubt on the efficacy of minor changes made to the CFC rules after a 2006 European Court of Justice case involving Cadbury Schweppes . This ruled that anti-avoidance rules could only be allowed to interfere with businesses ' freedom of establishment in the EU if they were proportionate and only attacked wholly artificial arrangements . "" The High Court has expressed ' some doubt ' as to the efficacy of sticking plaster amendments introduced in 2006 , "" Mr Persoff said . "" This means , as matters now stand , the UK probably has no enforceable CFC legislation so far as EU / EEA subsidiaries are concerned .

He said the company needed to further reduce its cost base in Europe , with the intention to at least maintain the level of dividends . The interim dividend of 3.27p a share has been raised 7.2 per cent . Vodafone is confident it can use capital allowances acquired with Cable & Wireless Worldwide for the UK business . The company has not provisioned for any loss in a long-running tax case in India , saying it was confident of success . Robin Bienenstock , analyst at Bernstein , said there were poor numbers in "" pretty much every region 's top and bottom lines "" . Vodafone said data revenues rose by 13.7 per cent . However , revenues from voice and text fell in the period . Lex , Page 16 Lombard , Page 18 Credit : By Daniel Thomas",vodafone writes down $5.9bn
13-01-2010,989,"Vouchers flatter Christmas at Tesco A push by Tesco to boost sales during the Christmas period by issuing pound(s)100m of money-saving vouchers to members of its loyalty scheme helped Britain 's largest retailer achieve what it described as its best festive season performance for three years . Tesco reported UK sales growth , in stores open at least a year , of 4.9 per cent in the six weeks to January 9 , ahead of analysts ' expectations of about 3 per cent expansion and the 2.8 per cent increase in the third quarter . The retailer beefed up its Clubcard scheme with the pound(s)100m of extra vouchers in an effort to close the gap on faster-growing rivals . But some analysts feared the vouchers would "" artificially "" inflate sales and called on the company to reveal their impact . In response , Tesco detailed for the first time how its voucher promotions boosted sales . It disclosed that pound(s)34m more Clubcard vouchers were redeemed in the six weeks to January 9 than in the period a year earlier . Stripping out the promotion under an accounting standard for loyalty schemes , UK like-for-like sales growth was 4.1 per cent in the festive season . Tesco shares rose 3.15p to 421p on the trading statement but some analysts expressed concern . Dave McCarthy at Evolution Securities said : "" The fact that less than half of the extra mailshot vouchers were used looks disappointing to us . "" Laurie McIlwee , finance director , defended the scheme , in which Tesco is investing hundreds of millions of pounds , and said the proportion of vouchers redeemed was "" bang in line "" with expectations . Only about 75 per cent of vouchers were ever redeemed in Tesco stores , he said , and only about 50 per cent of these were cashed in within eight weeks . Mr McIlwee said the UK sales performance showed Tesco had regained ground in the UK . "" We have gone from joining the pack to right at the front , "" he said . But he forecast another tough year as Britain faced a "" slow recovery "" , and warned against government measures to cut its debt burden while the economy remained fragile . Group sales rose 6.9 per cent , with international sales 2.4 per cent higher , or 4.1 per cent excluding the effect of currency movements . In the fledgling US business , sales rose 35 per cent , excluding exchange rates . But US like-for-like sales had risen in the "" mid-teen "" level , Mr McIlwee said . There was a "" very slight "" improvement in conditions on the West Coast , but it was "" still hard yards in California "" .

20-05-2009,991,"Weak revenues prompt Vodafone to heighten cost-cutting efforts Chief likely to raise pound(s)1bn reduction target ; Revenues hit by curbed spending on mobiles Vittorio Colao , Vodafone 's chief executive , yesterday signalled that he was likely to extend the company 's cost-cutting plans beyond an existing pound(s)1bn programme . His willingness to raise the pound(s)1bn target came after Vodafone 's 2008-09 results highlighted revenue weakness . Vodafone reported a 15.6 per cent rise in revenue to pound(s)41bn for the year to March 31 and a 16.7 per cent increase in operating profit before one-off items to pound(s)11.8bn. But the performance was largely driven by exchange rate movements , led by the euro 's strength against sterling . On an underlying basis , revenue fell 0.4 per cent as consumers in western and emerging markets spent less on their mobile phones . Pre-tax profit fell 53.5 per cent to pound(s)4.2bn , mainly because of pound(s)5.9bn of impairment charges largely relating to Vodafone 's underperforming Spanish and Turkish businesses . Vodafone 's shares closed down almost 4 per cent at 122.4p. Mr Colao announced that he was accelerating the plans to cut operating expenses by pound(s)1bn by March 2011 . He said pound(s)650m of savings would be achieved by March 2010 compared with previous plans of pound(s)500m . Mr Colao then went further , hinting that he could push cost-cutting beyond the pound(s)1bn target at Vodafone 's half-year results for 2009-10 in November . "" We are looking at ways of expanding the pound(s)1bn , "" he said . "" We will come back in November on the expansion of the pound(s)1bn . For the time being , it is an -acceleration . "" For the first time in a set of full-year results , underlying revenue fell at Vodafone 's European businesses , which contribute more than 70 per cent of sales . Vodafone met its target on free cash flow - broadly defined as cash from operating activities minus capital spending , and its main performance metric - by generating pound(s)5.7bn in 2008-09 . The full-year dividend rose 3.5 per cent to 7.77p. Basic earnings per share fell 53.5 per cent to 5.81p. Vodafone gave no revenue guidance for 2009-10 and said adjusted operating profit - excluding one-off items such as impairment charges - should at best match 2008-09 . Operating profit should be pound(s)11bn-11.8bn in 2009-10 . Free cash flow should be pound(s)6bn-6.5bn.

16-04-2008,993,"Winning ways at Tesco Bookies sometimes offer odds for those who want to "" bet without the favourite "" - a wager on who will come second to an obvious winner . A gamble on Tesco 's rivals , judging from yesterday 's figures on current trading , is even less certain . Not only is Tesco ahead , its tactics are probably biting into the market share of the other runners . In the first five weeks of its financial year ( since February 23 ) , like-for-like sales grew at 4 per cent . The latest British Retail Consortium figures indicate overall retail sales fell 1.6 per cent in March , with sales of food ( Tesco 's strongpoint ) slowing . Even if Tesco 's non-food offering comes under pressure , it has greater flexibility than specialist retailers to tailor its range , and more firepower than other supermarkets to adjust its food promotions to demand . The shares trade at a multiple of 15 times 2008-09 forecast earnings . That 's an attractive price for the favourite . andrew.hill@ft.com To comment , visit www.ft.com / lombard",winning ways at tesco
